[Function] Manage flashcard decks in AnkiDroid

[Core Logic Task]
The process starts on the AnkiDroid main page. First, the refresh icon is clicked, which opens an export dialog. Then, the CANCEL button is clicked, likely to dismiss the export dialog and return to the main page.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Refresh icon> and directly click <CANCEL button> (though this may not be meaningful in context, it's a mutation of omitting a step)
 - V2: Click <Refresh icon> twice and then click <CANCEL button> (repeat operation mutation)
 - V3: Click <CANCEL button> first and then click <Refresh icon> (order mutation, swap the two steps)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[1] =================
[Function] This page functions as a side navigation menu in AnkiDroid, providing access to features like deck management, card browsing, statistics, night mode toggle, settings, help, and feedback options.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts by clicking the hamburger menu icon on the main page to open the side navigation menu. Once the menu is open, clicking the 'Decks' navigation option (which is a leaf action) completes the interaction with this functional point's core logic for accessing deck management.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Hamburger menu icon> twice (repeat step)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Decks navigation option> after opening the menu (omit step)
 - V3: Tap <Hamburger menu icon> then immediately tap it again before tapping <Decks navigation option> (order + repeat mutation)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[2] =================
[Function] The current page (via the three - dot menu) in AnkiDroid provides a set of functions including creating a filtered deck, checking the database, checking media, handling empty cards, restoring from backup, managing note types, importing, and exporting the collection, to assist with the management and maintenance of flashcard decks and related data.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the main AnkiDroid page (page 0) and clicks the three - dot menu icon. This action opens a menu (page 3) that presents various deck - management options like creating a filtered deck, checking the database, etc. The user can then choose one of these options to perform the corresponding deck - related management task.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Tap <Three-dot menu icon> and then immediately tap <Three-dot menu icon> again (repeat the menu opening)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Three-dot menu icon> (try to access the management options without opening the menu, which should fail)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[3] =================
[Function] This page in AnkiDroid is for reviewing flashcards in the 'Default' deck, allowing users to view the question and then tap 'SHOW ANSWER' to reveal the answer, with a progress indicator (1 0 1) and options for navigation, bookmarking, and more via the menu icons.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the deck selection page and clicks the 'Default' deck (labeled with progress 1 0 1) to enter the flashcard review screen. Once in the review screen, the user clicks the 'SHOW ANSWER' button to reveal the answer for the current flashcard. The flow is a straight line with no branches or loops in this captured logic.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Deck named '123'> instead of the 'Default' deck to enter the flashcard review screen, then tap <SHOW ANSWER button> to reveal the answer
 - V2: Tap <SHOW ANSWER button> first without entering the flashcard review screen from a deck (invalid but for mutation), then try to tap <Deck named '123'>
 - V3: Omit tapping <SHOW ANSWER button> after entering the flashcard review screen from <Deck named '123'>

================= [TaskTest] FDG[4] =================
[Function] This page in AnkiDroid is for reviewing flashcards in the 'Default' deck, allowing the user to view the question and then tap 'SHOW ANSWER' to reveal the answer, with a progress indicator (1 0 1) and options for navigation or marking.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the deck list page and clicks the 'Default' deck to enter its review mode. Once in the deck, the user can view flashcard questions and use the 'SHOW ANSWER' button (implied by the functional point) to reveal answers, with progress tracking via the '1 0 1' indicator. The flow begins with selecting the deck, and subsequent steps (implied by the functional point's description) involve reviewing cards, though only the deck selection action is provided here.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Deck named 'Default'> twice (repeat deck selection)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Deck named 'Default'> (though this would skip entering review mode, testing if the app handles no deck selection)
 - V3: Tap <Deck named 'Default'>, then immediately tap <Deck named 'Default'> again (order mutation with repeated deck selection)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[5] =================
[Function] This page in AnkiDroid displays existing flashcard decks (like "123" and "Default") and provides a floating action plus button to initiate the creation of a new flashcard deck, while also showing study statistics (cards studied and time spent today) and options for syncing or accessing more menu actions.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the AnkiDroid deck list page, which shows existing decks and study stats. To create a new deck, the user clicks the floating action plus button. This action likely initiates the new deck creation process, though the flow here is a single step with no branches or loops yet.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Floating action plus button> twice (repeat operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Floating action plus button> (skip new deck creation step)
 - V3: Tap <Floating action plus button> after a very long delay (simulating a delayed interaction)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[6] =================
[Function] The current page in AnkiDroid's Card browser allows users to view, organize, and potentially edit the flashcards (displayed with "Question" and "Answer" columns) from all decks, with options to add new cards, search, and access additional menu actions.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 1 (the menu page) and clicks the 'Card browser' option. This action navigates to page 5 (the Card browser page), where flashcards are displayed with 'Question' and 'Answer' columns, and options for further actions like adding, searching, or menu access are available.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Card browser option> (staying on page 1 instead of navigating to page 5)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Card browser option> multiple times (e.g., click it twice in a row)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[7] =================
[Function] The current page in AnkiDroid displays statistics for the "Default" flashcard deck, providing an overview of today's study activity, 1 - month forecast, review count, review time, added cards, and interval data, with additional tabs for forecast, review count, and review time details.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 1 (menu) and clicks the 'Statistics' option. This action navigates to page 6, which displays the 'Default' deck's statistics, including today’s activity, 1 - month forecast, and other metrics, with tabs for further details. No branches or loops are present as it’s a single navigation step to the statistics page.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Statistics option> (to test if the stats page loads without interaction, though this may be invalid as per app flow but is a mutation)
 - V2: Click <Statistics option> twice (repeat the action to see if it has any effect, like reloading stats)
 - V3: Click <Statistics option> after a short delay (simulate a different interaction timing, though the widget is just 'Statistics option' so this is about the action's timing as a mutation)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[8] =================
[Function] Night mode toggle

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 1 (the menu with the Night mode toggle). The core logic is a single step: clicking the Night mode toggle, which transitions to page 7 (presumably reflecting the new night mode state). There are no branches or loops as it’s a direct toggle action.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Night mode toggle> twice (repeat the toggle action)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Night mode toggle> (check if the app still transitions to page 7 without interaction, though this may not be valid but trying as per repeat/omit mutation)
 - V3: Tap <Night mode toggle> (original action, included for comparison but mutation here is about variations; however, given the limited widgets, this is the base and others are mutations around it)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[9] =================
[Function] The current page (Preferences in AnkiDroid) allows users to access and configure different categories of settings including general, reviewing, appearance, gestures, and advanced options for the AnkiDroid application.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 1 (the side menu) and clicks the 'Settings' option. This action navigates to the Preferences page (page 8), where different categories of AnkiDroid settings (general, reviewing, appearance, gestures, advanced) become accessible for configuration.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Settings option> (check if navigation to Preferences page still occurs without this action)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Settings option> multiple times (check if it causes any unexpected behavior like multiple navigations or errors)
 - V3: Click <Settings option> and then immediately click it again (simulate rapid repeated action to test stability)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[10] =================
[Function] This page is the initial setup screen for Google Chrome, prompting the user to accept Chrome's Terms of Service and Privacy Notice, and offering the option to send usage statistics and crash reports to Google before proceeding with the browser setup.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 1 and clicks the 'Help' option, which navigates to page 9. This is a single-step flow with no branches or loops.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Help option> (simulate not interacting with the only available widget)
 - V2: Repeat tapping <Help option> (tap it multiple times instead of once)
 - V3: Since there's only one widget, no branch alternative, but try a boundary-like mutation: Tap <Help option> with an imaginary long-press (even though it's described as 'Help option' without long-press, but to meet mutation goal, simulate long-press <Help option>)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[11] =================
[Function] This page is the initial setup screen for Google Chrome, where users are prompted to accept Chrome's Terms of Service and Privacy Notice, and have the option to enable sending usage statistics and crash reports to Google before proceeding with the "ACCEPT & CONTINUE" button.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the initial Chrome setup page. They can choose to enable or disable sending usage statistics and crash reports (via a checkbox). After making that choice (or leaving it default), they click the 'ACCEPT & CONTINUE' button to proceed. If they interact with the 'Send feedback' option (though this is outside the core setup flow shown here), it navigates to a feedback page.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Send feedback option> before interacting with the 'ACCEPT & CONTINUE' button (order mutation: swapping the order of feedback interaction and setup confirmation)
 - V2: Tap <Send feedback option> twice (repeat mutation: repeating the feedback interaction)
 - V3: Omit interacting with the 'Send feedback option' and directly click 'ACCEPT & CONTINUE' (omit mutation: omitting the feedback step)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[12] =================
[Function] The current page is the AnkiWeb account login interface, allowing users to enter their email address and password to log in to their AnkiWeb account, with additional options to reset the password or sign up for a new account.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the AnkiWeb account login page. First, they can click the LOG IN button (though this likely requires prior input). Alternatively, they can interact with the Email address input field to enter their email, or the Password input field to enter their password. These input actions are part of the process to log in, with the LOG IN button being the final action to attempt login, and options to reset password or sign up also available.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <LOG IN button> without entering email or password (omit input steps)
 - V2: Input a very long string (exceeding typical email length) into <Email address input field> then tap <LOG IN button>
 - V3: Enter email into <Email address input field>, then tap <LOG IN button> without entering password (omit password input step)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[13] =================

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 3 and clicks the 'Create filtered deck option' (action_ref [3,0]), which navigates to page 2. This action initiates the process related to deck management, likely leading to a filtered deck creation workflow or related functionality.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Create filtered deck option> twice
 - V2: Omit tapping <Create filtered deck option> (though this skips the core action, testing if the app handles the absence)
 - V3: Tap <Create filtered deck option> then tap it again (repeating the action)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[14] =================
[Function] This page allows the user to export their AnkiDroid collection as an apkg file, with options to include scheduling and media, and confirm or cancel the export action.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 3, clicks the 'Check database option' (though this seems misaligned with the export goal; likely a prior step), then transitions to page 2 where the export dialog appears. From there, the user can choose to include scheduling/media, then confirm (OK) or cancel the export. However, with the given action, the first step is clicking the check database option, leading to page 2 (export dialog).

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Check database option> (to test if export dialog appears without this step, though core logic implies it's a prior step)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Check database option> multiple times before expecting the export dialog

================= [TaskTest] FDG[15] =================
[Function] This page (dialog) in AnkiDroid allows the user to export their flashcard collection as an .apkg file, with options to include scheduling and/or media, and confirm or cancel the export action.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 3 and clicks to check the media option, transitioning to page 2. This step is part of configuring the export settings for the flashcard collection, specifically enabling the inclusion of media in the export.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit checking the media option: Start on page 3 and proceed without interacting with <Check media option>, then see if the export configuration proceeds to page 2 or behaves differently
 - V2: Repeat checking the media option: Start on page 3, tap <Check media option>, then tap <Check media option> again, and observe the transition to page 2 or any changes in the export configuration state

================= [TaskTest] FDG[16] =================

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 3 (AnkiDroid main menu) and clicks the 'Empty cards option' (action_ref [3,3]), which navigates to page 2 (the Export dialog). This step initiates the process of accessing the export functionality, leading to the dialog where export options (like scheduling and media) can be configured and confirmed/canceled.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Long-press <Empty cards option> instead of tapping to see if it initiates export
 - V2: Tap <Empty cards option> twice to check if multiple exports are triggered
 - V3: Omit tapping <Empty cards option> to see if export process can start another way

================= [TaskTest] FDG[17] =================
[Function] The current page (Export dialog) allows the user to export their AnkiDroid collection as an apkg file, with options to include scheduling and media, and confirm or cancel the export action.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the main AnkiDroid page (page 3). They click the 'Restore from backup' option, which navigates them to the Export dialog (page 2).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Restore from backup option> (test if export dialog still appears without this action)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Restore from backup option> twice (test if multiple clicks cause unexpected behavior)
 - V3: Click <Restore from backup option> and then immediately click it again (swap order of a non - existent second action with itself, testing repeated action)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[18] =================
[Function] The "Manage note types" page in AnkiDroid allows users to view, organize, and potentially create or modify different note types (e.g., Basic, Cloze) used for creating flashcards, with a summary of the number of notes associated with each type.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 3 and clicks the 'Manage note types' option. This action navigates to the 'Manage note types' page (page 141), where note types and their associated note counts are displayed. There are no branches or loops in this initial flow as only one action is provided.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Manage note types option> (to test if the page still navigates without the action, though this is an omit mutation)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Manage note types option> (to test if multiple clicks affect navigation or cause issues, a repeat mutation)
 - V3: Click <Manage note types option> twice in a row (another form of repeat mutation, different from the previous repeat in wording but similar intent)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[19] =================
[Function] The current page (Export dialog) in AnkiDroid allows the user to export their flashcard collection as an apkg file, with options to include scheduling and media, and buttons to confirm (OK) or cancel (CANCEL) the export.

[Core Logic Task]
The process starts on the card browser page. First, the user clicks the three - dot (more options) menu. After this click, a menu with options like changing display order, filtering marked, filtering suspended, and filtering by tag appears, and the user can then choose one of these options to modify card display or filtering.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <More options (three-dot)> and assume the menu is already open (though this is an invalid operation in normal flow but a mutation to test boundary of menu interaction)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <More options (three-dot)> multiple times instead of proceeding to choose an option from the opened menu
 - V3: Click <More options (three-dot)> but instead of choosing a valid option, click it again (simulating an incorrect interaction flow)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[25] =================
[Function] The page allows the user to select a specific flashcard deck (from options like "All decks", "123", "Default") to view detailed statistics (including today's study, 1 - month forecast, review count, review time, added cards, and intervals) for that deck.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 6 (statistics page for a deck). They click the deck dropdown (labeled 'Default' initially) to open a menu with options like 'All decks', '123', and 'Default'. This action allows selecting a different deck to view its statistics, with the flow focusing on initiating the deck selection process.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Default deck dropdown> twice in a row
 - V2: Omit tapping <Default deck dropdown> (stay on the initially loaded deck's statistics)
 - V3: Tap <Default deck dropdown> and then immediately tap it again without selecting an option from the menu

================= [TaskTest] FDG[26] =================
[Function] The current page (FORECAST tab in AnkiDroid's Statistics section) displays a graph to forecast the cumulative number of mature, young, and total (cumulative) flashcards over a 30 - day period for the "Default" deck, aiding users in predicting their flashcard review workload.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Statistics page (page 6). They click the 'FORECAST' tab, which navigates to the FORECAST section (page 41) displaying a graph that forecasts the cumulative number of mature, young, and total flashcards over a 30 - day period for the 'Default' deck. There are no branches or loops in this flow as it is a simple navigation to view the forecast graph.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit tapping <FORECAST tab> and check if the graph still appears (to test if the tab is necessary for the graph to show)
 - V2: Tap <FORECAST tab> twice (to test if repeated tapping affects the graph display)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[27] =================
[Function] The current page in AnkiDroid's Statistics section, under the "REVIEW COUNT" tab, displays a graph visualizing the cumulative number of answers (categorized as Mature, Young, Relearn, Learn, Cram) over a period of days, allowing users to analyze their flashcard review activity trends.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Statistics page (page 6) and clicks the 'REVIEW COUNT' tab to navigate to the REVIEW COUNT page (page 42). Once on the REVIEW COUNT page, the user can click the 'REVIEW COUNT' tab again (though this is a leaf action, likely confirming or re-rendering the graph). The core flow is navigating to the REVIEW COUNT tab to view the cumulative answers graph, with a possible re-interaction with the tab on the target page.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Start on the Statistics page, omit clicking <REVIEW COUNT tab> (intentionally stay on the initial page to see if the graph still appears, though logically it shouldn't)
 - V2: Start on the Statistics page, click <REVIEW COUNT tab> to go to the REVIEW COUNT page, then immediately click <REVIEW COUNT tab> again (repeating the interaction to see if it refreshes or has any side effect)
 - V3: Start on the Statistics page, click <REVIEW COUNT tab> twice in quick succession (combining the two clicks into a rapid sequence, testing if the app handles repeated navigation quickly)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[28] =================
