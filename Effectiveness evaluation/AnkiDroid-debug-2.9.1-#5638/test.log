================= [TaskTest] FDG[67] =================
[Function] The current page in AnkiDroid's statistics section, under the FORECAST and REVIEW COUNT tabs, visualizes the cumulative number of answers (categorized by card types: Mature, Young, Relearn, Learn, Cram) over a range of days (from -30 to 0 days relative to the current time) to help users analyze and forecast their flashcard review counts.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the statistics page (page 34) with the FORECAST tab active. They click on the REVIEW COUNT tab (action_ref [34,1]), which navigates to page 35. On page 35, the REVIEW COUNT tab is active, displaying a graph of cumulative answers (by card type) over the range of -30 to 0 days, allowing analysis of review counts.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <REVIEW COUNT tab> and stay on the FORECAST tab to check if the graph still shows cumulative answers (even though the core logic is for REVIEW COUNT, this tests if the data is shared or not).
 - V2: Click <REVIEW COUNT tab> multiple times (e.g., 3 times) to see if the page reloads or behaves unexpectedly (repeat operation mutation).

================= [TaskTest] FDG[140] =================
[Function] The page displays statistics for the "Default" flashcard deck in AnkiDroid, specifically showing a pie chart breakdown of card types (Mature, Young+Learn, Unseen, Suspended+Buried) under the "CARD TYPES" tab.

[Core Logic Task]
The process starts on the statistics page for the 'Default' deck. The user clicks on the 'CARD TYPES' tab, which navigates to the page displaying the pie chart breakdown of card types (Mature, Young+Learn, Unseen, Suspended+Buried).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <CARD TYPES tab> and check if the pie chart still appears (though likely it won't, testing the necessity of the tab tap)
 - V2: Tap <CARD TYPES tab> twice (testing repeated interaction with the tab)
 - V3: Wait for a moment and then tap <CARD TYPES tab> (testing delayed interaction with the tab)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[141] =================
[Function] The current page provides a text input field labeled "Find in page" along with navigation buttons (up, down, and close) to search for specific text within the currently loaded web page in the Chrome browser.

[Core Logic Task]
To search text in the web page, first click the 'Find in page' option. Then, click the input field to enter the search text. After entering text, you can click the next match (↓) or previous match (↑) buttons to navigate results, or click the close (X) button to exit the search. The next/previous buttons can be repeated to cycle through matches.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Find in page option>, Input empty string into <Find in page input field>, Tap <Next match button (↓)>
 - V2: Tap <Find in page option>, Input "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" into <Find in page input field>, Tap <Next match button (↓)>
 - V3: Tap <Find in page option>, Input "test!@#$%^&*()" into <Find in page input field>, Tap <Previous match button (↑)>, Tap <Close search button (X)>

================= [TaskTest] FDG[142] =================
[Function] This page in AnkiDroid's Advanced settings allows the user to adjust the "Max number of backups" setting using a slider, with the current value set to 8.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 61 and clicks the 'Add to Home screen' option, which navigates to page 63. This is a straight - line flow with no branches or loops as there's only one action.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Add to Home screen option> and check if navigation to page 63 still occurs
 - V2: Tap <Add to Home screen option> twice and observe if it navigates to page 63 both times or has a different behavior
 - V3: Tap <Add to Home screen option> and then immediately tap it again before the navigation completes (if possible) and see the result

================= [TaskTest] FDG[143] =================
[Function] Desktop site checkbox

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 61 and clicks the 'Desktop site' checkbox, which leads to page 64. This is a single-step flow with no branches or loops.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Desktop site checkbox> (check if the app still navigates or behaves unexpectedly)
 - V2: Tap <Desktop site checkbox> twice (test repeated interaction effect)
 - V3: Long-press <Desktop site checkbox> instead of tapping (test alternative interaction type)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[144] =================
[Function] The page allows the user to choose a browser (Chrome or WebView Browser Tester) to open the AnkiWeb website, with options to set the chosen browser as the default for this action or use it just once.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts by clicking the 'Open in browser' option. Then, in the 'Open with' dialog, the user clicks the 'WebView Browser Tester' option to proceed with opening the AnkiWeb site in that browser.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Open in browser option>, then tap <Chrome option> (branch mutation: choose Chrome instead of WebView Browser Tester)
 - V2: Omit tapping <WebView Browser Tester option> after tapping <Open in browser option> (omit step mutation)
 - V3: Tap <WebView Browser Tester option> first, then tap <Open in browser option> (order mutation, though UI flow might be unnatural but follows constraint)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[145] =================
[Function] This page allows the user to navigate the SDCARD storage directory (specifically the LOST.DIR folder) to select a location and confirm the file name ("collection.apkg") for saving the exported AnkiDroid collection package.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the SDCARD page. They click on the LOST.DIR folder to navigate into it, which leads to a new directory view. The process focuses on selecting the LOST.DIR folder as the target location for saving the collection.apkg file.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <LOST.DIR folder> and attempt to save the file (check if app allows saving without selecting a folder)
 - V2: Tap <LOST.DIR folder> twice (repeat the folder selection step)
 - V3: Try to save the file with an empty or modified file name (if file name input is a widget, but since not provided, assume boundary input for file name as part of mutation: attempt to save with file name as empty string instead of 'collection.apkg' after selecting <LOST.DIR folder>)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[146] =================
[Function] This page in AnkiDroid allows users to manage their flashcard decks, view deck details (like the number of due cards and study statistics), and provides options to add new decks or access additional features via the menu.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the SDCARD page and clicks on the 'ActivityDiary_Ex...' file tile, which navigates to the AnkiDroid deck management page. This action likely relates to importing or managing deck content, transitioning from the file browser to the app's deck interface.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <ActivityDiary_Ex... file tile> twice (repeat the tap operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <ActivityDiary_Ex... file tile> (simulate not initiating the navigation to the deck management page)
 - V3: Tap <ActivityDiary_Ex... file tile> after a long delay (simulate a timing-related mutation in the interaction)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[147] =================
[Function] The current page (WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab in AnkiDroid's statistics) visualizes weekly study metrics, including percentage of correct answers (dark bars) and number of answers (light bars) per day of the week, with dual y - axes for % correct (left) and reviews (right).

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 41 (statistics page) and clicks the 'WEEKLY BREAKDOWN' tab. This action navigates to page 39, where the weekly study metrics (correct percentage and answer count per day) are visualized with dual y - axes.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab> and check if the weekly metrics still appear (though this likely fails as per core logic, but it's a mutation to test the necessity of the click)
 - V2: Click <WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab> twice (unusual repetition to see if app reacts differently)
 - V3: Try to click <WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab> while assuming a different initial page (boundary-like in terms of context mutation, though UI-wise it's just the same click but with a different precondition assumption)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[148] =================
[Function] The current page (ANSWER BUTTONS tab in AnkiDroid's statistics) visualizes the number of answers for different answer types, categorized by card states (Learn, Young, Mature), to help users analyze their response patterns across card types.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 41 (Statistics) and clicks the 'ANSWER BUTTONS' tab. This action navigates to page 40, where the visualization of answer counts by card states (Learn, Young, Mature) and answer types is displayed. There are no branches or loops, as the flow is a single step to access the desired tab's content.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> and check if the visualization still appears (though expected to fail as per core logic)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> multiple times to see if it causes any unexpected behavior (e.g., repeated navigation or errors)
 - V3: Click <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> and then immediately click it again to simulate a double - click mutation

================= [TaskTest] FDG[149] =================
[Function] The page allows the user to select a browser (Chrome or WebView Browser Tester) to open the AnkiWeb website, with options to set the selection as temporary ("JUST ONCE") or permanent ("ALWAYS").

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the page where the user can choose a browser to open AnkiWeb. The user clicks on the Chrome browser option. Since only one action is provided, the flow consists of this single step with no branching or further steps shown.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Chrome browser option> twice (repeat the tap operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Chrome browser option> (though this might not complete the task, but it's a mutation of omitting the step)
 - V3: Try to tap <Chrome browser option> with a very long press (simulating an incorrect interaction type, though the widget is a tap target, this is a mutation of interaction style)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[150] =================
[Function] This page displays the contents of the LOST.DIR folder (showing it is empty) while providing an interface to save the exported AnkiDroid collection file (collection.apkg) to this directory.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on a page showing a folder. A click action navigates to the LOST.DIR folder, which is displayed as empty (with 'No items' text). The interface then allows saving the 'collection.apkg' file to this directory, though the save action itself is not part of the provided steps here.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <com.google.and... folder> multiple times (repeat the navigation step)
 - V2: Omit tapping <com.google.and... folder> (skip the navigation to LOST.DIR)
 - V3: Tap <com.google.and... folder> in a different order (if there were other steps, but here just reordering the single tap action contextually)
