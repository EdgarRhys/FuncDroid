}

Wait, actually, the widget descriptions only have "Notifications option". So the possible mutations are:

1. Omit clicking <Notifications option> (test if the Notifications page can be accessed without this action, though it's likely not possible, but it's a mutation to test the step's necessity).
2. Repeat clicking <Notifications option> (click it twice, see if it navigates twice or causes an error).
3. Click <Notifications option> and then try to navigate back immediately (but since there's no back widget in the descriptions, maybe not. Alternatively, the only widget is <Notifications option>, so the mutations are around interacting with it in different ways: omit, repeat, or maybe a different order (but there's only one step here: click <Notifications option> to go to Notifications page. So the order mutation would be if there were two steps, but here it's one step. So the three mutations are:

1. Omit clicking <Notifications option> (test if the Notifications page is accessible without this action).
2. Repeat clicking <Notifications option> (click it twice, observe behavior).
3. Click <Notifications option> and then do nothing (but that's similar to the first, maybe not. Alternatively, since the core logic is to navigate to Notifications page by clicking <Notifications option>, the mutations are:

- Omit: Don't click <Notifications option> and check if Notifications page is visible.
- Repeat: Click <Notifications option> twice (maybe it opens the page twice or an error).
- Boundary: Not applicable as no input. So the three mutations are:

[
  "Do not click <Notifications option> and check if the Notifications page is accessible",
  "Click <Notifications option> twice and observe the result",
  "Click <Notifications option> and then immediately click it again (repeat the action)"

[Function] Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Playback settings page (page 66). They perform a click action on the 'Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect' toggle, which likely toggles its state (on/off) to change the playback behavior when headphones/Bluetooth disconnect. This action completes the functional point's logic as it's a single-step toggle interaction.
{
  "variant_paths": [
    "Tap <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> twice (repeating the toggle action)",
    "Omit tapping <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> (simulating not performing the toggle)",
    "Tap <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> (original action as a reference, but since it's a single step, this is the base; however, to meet mutation, the first two are the mutations)"
  ]
}

Wait, the core logic is a single step. Let's adjust. The mutations should be based on the allowed types. Let's generate valid ones:

1. Repeat: Tap <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> then tap it again (repeating the toggle).
2. Omit: Do not tap <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> (omitting the step).
3. Since there's no input, boundary input doesn't apply. So the variant paths:

{
  "variant_paths": [
    "Tap <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> and then tap <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> again (repeating the toggle action)",
    "Do not tap <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> (omitting the toggle step)",
    "Tap <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> (original action, but as a mutation, maybe not, but to meet the count, we can have these three)"
  ]
}

But the first two are valid mutations (repeat and omit). The third can be the original, but since mutation is about changing, maybe better to have two, but the problem says up to 3. So final:

{
  "variant_paths": [
    "Tap <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> twice (repeating the toggle operation)",
    "Omit tapping <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> (skipping the toggle step)",
    "Tap <Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect toggle> once (original action, included for completeness as a base case)"
  ]

[Function] Confirm button

[Core Logic Task]
The user is presented with a confirmation dialog to remove all 'new' flags from episodes. The core logic involves clicking the 'Confirm' button to proceed with removing the flags, transitioning to the next page (19) after the action.
{
  "variant_paths": [
    "Omit tapping <Confirm button> (check if the app still transitions or shows an error)",
    "Tap <Confirm button> twice (check if the action repeats or causes an error)",
    "Tap <Confirm button> (original action as a baseline, but here included to contrast mutations; though in mutation terms, the other two are the mutations)"
  ]
}

Wait, but the widget list only has "Confirm button". Let's adjust to meet the constraints properly. The original action is tap Confirm button. So mutations:

1. Omit tapping Confirm button (see if the app proceeds or not)
2. Tap Confirm button twice (see if double-tap has different effect)
3. Since no input widgets, boundary input not possible. Order mutation: only one step, so no. So two mutations plus maybe a third. Wait, the core logic is click Confirm to transition. So possible mutations:

- Omit tapping <Confirm button> (step omitted)
- Tap <Confirm button> twice (repeat operation)
- Tap <Confirm button> once (original, but maybe the third is to see if not tapping, but that's same as omit. Alternatively, maybe the third is to tap and then tap again, but that's same as double-tap. So let's structure:

{
  "variant_paths": [
    "Omit tapping <Confirm button> (observe if the app transitions to page 19 or stays)",
    "Tap <Confirm button> twice (observe if the action is repeated or causes an error)",
    "Tap <Confirm button> once (original action, included for comparison; though the mutations are the first two)"
  ]
}

But maybe the third can be a different mutation. Wait, the widget is only Confirm button. So possible mutations:

1. Omit the step (don't tap Confirm)
2. Repeat the step (tap Confirm twice)
3. Maybe tap Confirm, then tap again (same as 2). Alternatively, if the app has a state, maybe tapping Confirm when already processed. But given the info, the above is the best.

[Function] The page allows the user to select the statistics mode for calculating podcast playback duration, with options to count actual playback (including repeated plays) or sum episodes marked as played, and confirms the selection with an "OK" button.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Statistics page, clicks the 'Statistics mode' option to open the mode selection dialog. In the dialog, the user can choose between counting actual playback (with repeated plays) or summing marked-as-played episodes (via radio buttons), then confirms the choice by clicking 'OK' to apply the selected mode and return to the Statistics page.
{
  "variant_paths": [
    "Start on Statistics page, tap <Radio option: actual played duration> twice (repeating selection), then tap <OK confirmation button>",
    "Start on Statistics page, omit tapping <Statistics mode option> (invalid, but for mutation), then try tapping <OK confirmation button>",
    "Start on Statistics page, tap <Statistics mode option>, then input special chars (but no input widget, so invalid, but for mutation, try to interact with non-input widget as input)"
  ]
}

Wait, the above has invalid mutations because some steps don't follow the widget descriptions. Let's correct it:

Valid mutations based on the widget descriptions (widgets: "Statistics mode option", "Radio option: actual played duration", "OK confirmation button"):

1. Branch mutation: Instead of <Radio option: actual played duration>, if there was another radio option (but in given widgets, only this radio? Wait, the core logic says two options: actual playback (including repeated plays) or sum episodes marked as played. So maybe the other radio is "Radio option: sum marked played episodes" (but widget_descriptions only has "Radio option: actual played duration"? Wait, the user provided widget_descriptions as ["Statistics mode option", "Radio option: actual played duration", "OK confirmation button"]. Oh, maybe the other radio is missing? But according to the problem, we can only use widgets in the list. So maybe the branch mutation is to not select the radio (but that's not a valid option). Wait, maybe the original flow is: tap Statistics mode option, select radio (actual), tap OK. So mutation could be:

- Omit selecting the radio (tap Statistics mode option, then tap OK without selecting radio)
- Repeat selecting the radio (tap Statistics mode option, tap radio twice, then tap OK)
- Boundary input: but no input widget, so maybe not. Wait, the widget_descriptions don't have an input field. So possible mutations:

1. Omit step: Start on Statistics page, tap <Statistics mode option>, then tap <OK confirmation button> without tapping <Radio option: actual played duration> (to see if the app handles unselected radio)
2. Repeat step: Start on Statistics page, tap <Statistics mode option>, tap <Radio option: actual played duration> twice, then tap <OK confirmation button>
3. Order mutation: Swap steps (but steps are sequential: tap Statistics mode, select radio, tap OK. Can't swap radio and OK. Maybe tap OK first, then radio? But that's invalid, but for mutation: Start on Statistics page, tap <OK confirmation button> first, then tap <Statistics mode option>, then tap <Radio option: actual played duration> (invalid flow, but mutation)

So the valid (as per mutation goals, even if invalid in app logic) mutations:

Now, generating the JSON:

{
  "variant_paths": [
    "Start on Statistics page, tap <Statistics mode option>, then tap <OK confirmation button> without tapping <Radio option: actual played duration> (omit radio selection)",
    "Start on Statistics page, tap <Statistics mode option>, tap <Radio option: actual played duration> twice, then tap <OK confirmation button> (repeat radio selection)",
    "Start on Statistics page, tap <OK confirmation button> first, then tap <Statistics mode option>, then tap <Radio option: actual played duration> (swap OK and Statistics mode option steps)"
