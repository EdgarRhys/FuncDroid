The user starts on page 11 (deck selection dropdown open) and clicks the '123 deck option' to navigate to page 5, which displays all flashcards from the selected deck (or all decks? Wait, the second screenshot shows 'All decks' with 6 cards, so maybe the action is selecting a deck? Wait, the action_ref is [11,1], src_page_idx 11, dst_page_idx 5. The summary: click '123' deck option to switch to page showing cards from that deck (or all decks? The second screenshot has 'All decks' so maybe the action is closing the dropdown or selecting a deck? Wait, the first screenshot has a dropdown with 'All decks', '123', 'Default'. So clicking '123' would show cards from deck 123? But the second screenshot shows 'All decks'. Wait, maybe the action is selecting '123' deck, but the dst page is 5 which shows all decks? Maybe the initial page is the deck selection dropdown (page 11), and clicking '123' navigates to page 5 (card browser for 123 deck? But the second screenshot shows 'All decks'). Maybe the screenshots are misaligned. Anyway, following the action: the step is clicking '123 deck option' (from page 11's dropdown) to navigate to page 5 (card browser page, possibly showing 123 deck's cards or all decks). The logic is: The user is on the deck selection dropdown page (page 11). They click the '123' deck option, which navigates to page 5 (the card browser page displaying cards, likely from the 123 deck or all decks, depending on the app's behavior).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <123 deck option> twice (repeat the action)
 - V2: Omit tapping <123 deck option> (stay on page 11)
 - V3: Tap <123 deck option> and then immediately tap it again (order mutation with repetition)
