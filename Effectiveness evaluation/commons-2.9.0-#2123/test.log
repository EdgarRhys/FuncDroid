[Function] Home page with contributions and nearby

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the Home page. The user clicks the 'Contributions' tab, which remains on the Home page (likely refreshing or confirming the Contributions view). There are no branches or loops as only one action is defined.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Contributions tab> (since original flow has only this action, omitting it is a mutation to see if the app still shows Contributions view by default)
 - V2: Tap <Contributions tab> twice (repeat the only action to check if repeated tapping has different behavior, e.g., multiple refreshes or errors)
 - V3: Tap <Contributions tab> (original action, included here as a baseline for comparison, but since mutation needs change, maybe adjust: Wait 5 seconds then tap <Contributions tab> (order mutation with a delay step, though delay isn't a widget, but if we consider the action order, adding a delay before the tap is a mutation of the original immediate tap))

================= [TaskTest] FDG[1] =================
[Function] The current page is a navigation menu (hamburger menu) that provides access to various app sections including Home, Explore, Bookmarks, Notifications, Settings, About, Tutorial, Feedback, and Logout, allowing the user to navigate to different functional areas of the app.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Home page (page 0). They click the hamburger menu button, which opens the navigation menu (page 1) containing various app sections like Home, Explore, and others. This is a straight - line flow with no branches or loops as only one action is involved here.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Hamburger menu button,Navigation menu for app sections> twice (repeat the tap operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Hamburger menu button,Navigation menu for app sections> (try to access the menu without tapping the button, though this may not be valid UI behavior but is a mutation attempt)
 - V3: Tap <Hamburger menu button,Navigation menu for app sections> and then immediately tap it again (similar to repeat but with immediate re - tap)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[2] =================
[Function] The Notifications page displays a list of recent notifications (e.g., first edit confirmation, talk page message, welcome message) with timestamps, allowing the user to view updates and interactions related to their activity on the platform.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Home page. They click the notifications bell icon, which navigates to the Notifications page. On the Notifications page, the user can view a list of recent notifications (like edit confirmations, talk page messages, welcome messages) with timestamps, completing the flow to access and view these updates.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Notifications bell icon,View notifications> and try to view notifications directly from the Home page (though this should fail as per core logic, testing the dependency on the bell icon)
 - V2: Tap <Notifications bell icon,View notifications> multiple times (e.g., 3 times) to see if repeated taps affect navigation or the Notifications page display
 - V3: Swap the order (though in this simple flow there's only one main step, but hypothetically: View notifications first (impossible normally, but testing if the system allows) then tap <Notifications bell icon,View notifications>)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[3] =================
[Function] The current page is a loading screen for the "Nearby" tab on the home page, where it is retrieving and preparing to display nearby - related content.

[Core Logic Task]
