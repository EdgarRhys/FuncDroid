[Function] The current page (Insert Image dialog in QuickNote) allows the user to add a description, input a URL/path, or select from options (BROWSE FILESYSTEM, CAMERA PICTURE, GALLERY PICTURE, EDIT PICTURE) to insert an image into the QuickNote, with the "EDIT PICTURE" option enabling image editing before insertion.

[Core Logic Task]
The user is on the Insert Image dialog in QuickNote. The core logic involves interacting with the EDIT PICTURE button, which likely initiates an image editing process before inserting the image into the note. Since there's only one action provided, the flow is a single step of clicking the EDIT PICTURE button.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <EDIT PICTURE button> and try to insert image directly (though original flow implies it's needed, but for mutation, omit)
 - V2: Tap <EDIT PICTURE button> twice (repeat the operation)
 - V3: Since only one widget, branch mutation not possible with other widgets, but try to see if no interaction (though original has one step, but mutation could be no action)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[39] =================
[Function] This page allows the user to record audio (in WAV format) for attaching to a QuickNote, with options to start recording, cancel, or confirm the recording, and also displays the recording duration and file size.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts by clicking the RECORD AUDIO button to open the recording interface. Once in the Record Audio page, they can choose to either cancel the recording (returning to the previous page) or confirm the recording (also returning to the previous page) via the respective buttons.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <RECORD AUDIO button>, then immediately tap <CANCEL button in Record Audio> (skip actual recording attempt)
 - V2: Tap <RECORD AUDIO button>, then tap <OK button in Record Audio> without waiting for any recording (confirm empty recording)
 - V3: Tap <RECORD AUDIO button>, tap <CANCEL button in Record Audio>, then tap <RECORD AUDIO button> again (repeat opening recording interface)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[40] =================
[Function] Open app again option

[Core Logic Task]
When the app (Markor) stops, a dialog appears with an 'Open app again' option. The user clicks this option to attempt to restart the app. This is a single step with no branching or looping, as the action is to trigger the app to open again.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Open app again option> (to see if app restarts without interaction, though this is against normal flow but for mutation testing)
 - V2: Tap <Open app again option> twice (repeat the action to see if multiple triggers have an effect)
 - V3: Tap <Open app again option> (original action, included for completeness as a base but mutation here is about variations around it)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[41] =================
[Function] This page functions as a browser tab management interface, allowing the user to view, switch between, and manage (e.g., close) open browser tabs, including a YouTube tab, a GitHub discussions tab, and an Android API reference tab.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on a page with a browser tab. They click the '3 open tabs' indicator, which navigates to the tab management interface where open tabs (YouTube, GitHub, Android API) are visible for further actions like switching or closing.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <3 open tabs indicator> and try to manage tabs directly (though this may not work as per core logic, but it's a mutation of omitting the step)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <3 open tabs indicator> multiple times (e.g., click it twice in a row instead of once)
 - V3: Click <3 open tabs indicator> and then immediately click it again (order and repeat mutation)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[42] =================
[Function] The current page is a browser menu (Chrome) that provides options like opening new tabs, accessing bookmarks/history/downloads, sharing, finding in page, adding to home screen, enabling desktop site, adjusting settings, and accessing help/feedback, while the underlying page displays Android date and time formatting documentation.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the Chrome page displaying Android date/time documentation. The user clicks the browser menu button, which opens the menu with options like new tabs, bookmarks, sharing, and more. This is a single-step flow with no branches, as the action opens the menu to access its options.

[Variant Paths] (3)

 - V2: Omit tapping <Browser menu button> (skip opening the menu)
 - V3: Long-press <Browser menu button> instead of tapping (alternative interaction type)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[43] =================
[Function] This page functions as a file selection dialog (within a QuickNote link - insertion workflow) that allows navigation to the home directory (via the Home icon) and file/folder exploration (or cancellation via the "CANCEL" button) to select a file for linking in the QuickNote.

[Core Logic Task]
The file selection dialog for QuickNote link insertion starts on page 26. The user can click the Search icon button (on page 26) to initiate a search, with the flow remaining on page 26 after this action. Other actions like navigating via the Home icon or canceling via 'CANCEL' are implied but not in the provided actions list here, so the core step shown is the search button click.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Search icon button> (test if the dialog still functions or has default behavior without search initiation)
 - V2: Tap <Search icon button> twice (test if repeated search initiation has any different behavior or side effects)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[44] =================
[Function] The current page is an "Insert Image" dialog within the QuickNote editing interface, allowing users to add an image to their note by providing a description, entering a URL/path, or selecting an image source (filesystem, camera, gallery) and optionally editing the image before confirming or canceling the insertion.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts in the camera interface (page 31) and clicks the close camera button (X). This action navigates them back to the 'Insert Image' dialog (page 14) in the QuickNote editing interface, allowing them to continue the image insertion process or choose other options.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Close camera button (X)> and see if the camera interface remains (repeat the current state)

[Function] This page functions as a camera viewfinder interface, allowing the user to capture a photo (via the blue circle button) for insertion into a QuickNote, with additional options for closing the camera (X button) and toggling camera settings/modes (left and right icons).

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the camera viewfinder page (page 31). The core action here is clicking the camera switch icon (right side of the screen). After this click, the flow remains on the same page (page 31), likely updating the camera mode or settings as a result of the switch action.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Camera switch icon (right)> twice (repeat the switch action)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Camera switch icon (right)> (skip the core action)
 - V3: Tap <Camera switch icon (right)> and then immediately tap it again (order mutation with repeated step)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[47] =================
[Function] This page allows the user to select the Gallery app (from available options like Gallery or Photos) to insert a picture from the gallery into the QuickNote, after initiating the image insertion process in the QuickNote editing interface.

[Core Logic Task]
After initiating image insertion in QuickNote, the user is presented with a choice of apps (Gallery or Photos) to complete the action. The core logic is selecting the Gallery app: the user clicks on the 'Gallery' option to proceed with inserting an image from the gallery into the QuickNote.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit selecting <Gallery app option> (test if the system handles the absence of app selection)
 - V2: Repeat tapping <Gallery app option> (test if multiple selections cause issues)
 - V3: Tap <Gallery app option> twice in a row (simulate repeated app selection)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[48] =================
[Function] This page allows the user to select an app (either Gallery or Photos) to complete the action of inserting a gallery picture into the QuickNote.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on page 32 (Insert Image dialog with app selection). The user clicks the 'Photos' app option (action_ref [32,1]). Since there's only one step here (as per the provided action), the logic is a single click action to select the Photos app for inserting a gallery picture into QuickNote.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Photos app option> twice (repeat the selection step)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Photos app option> (simulate not selecting any app)
 - V3: Tap <Photos app option> (original step, included as a base for comparison, though mutation here is about alternative if existed, but since only one widget, these are the possible mutations)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[49] =================
[Function] Speaker audio toggle icon

[Core Logic Task]
The core execution logic starts on page 35. The user performs a click action on the speaker audio toggle icon, which transitions the app to page 36. There are no branches or loops in this flow as it is a single, direct action to toggle the speaker audio.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Speaker audio toggle icon> twice (repeat operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Speaker audio toggle icon> (skip the step)
 - V3: Tap <Speaker audio toggle icon> after a very long delay (simulate timing variation, though action is same but contextually a mutation in execution timing)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[50] =================
[Function] This page allows the user to start recording audio (in WAV format) for attachment to a QuickNote, with options to cancel or confirm the recording, and also displays recording duration and file size metrics.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts by clicking the red record start button to initiate audio recording. Since only one action is provided, the current logic focuses on starting the recording process, with the expectation that subsequent steps (not yet provided) would handle duration/file size updates, and choices to cancel or confirm the recording.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Red record start button> twice (repeat the start action)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Red record start button> (simulate not starting recording)
 - V3: Tap <Red record start button> with an unexpected long press (alter interaction type, though original is click; assuming long-press is a mutation here as a different interaction)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[51] =================
[Function] New tab button (+)

[Core Logic Task]
The functional point starts on page 41. The user clicks the 'New tab button (+)' (action_ref [41, 0]), which leads to page 43. There are no branches or loops as this is a single action flow.

[Variant Paths] (3)

[Core Logic Task]
The browser displays Android developer documentation about date/time pattern letters. The Chrome menu is accessed, and the 'Update Chrome' option is clicked, which likely leads to a page related to updating Chrome (though the flow here is a single click action from the menu on the documentation page).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Update Chrome option> (just view the documentation without attempting an update)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Update Chrome option> (click it multiple times instead of once)
 - V3: Try to interact with <Update Chrome option> in a different way (e.g., long-press instead of tap, though the description doesn't specify tap, but assuming default is tap, this is a mutation in interaction type)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[57] =================
[Function] This page is the new tab page of the Chrome browser, providing a search bar, quick access icons to popular websites, personalized article suggestions (currently empty), and an option to sign in to Chrome for personalized content, allowing users to start web browsing or access favorite sites quickly.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 42 and clicks the 'New tab' option (action_ref [42,1]). This action navigates to page 49, which is the Chrome new tab page. The new tab page displays a search bar, quick access icons for popular sites, an empty personalized article section, and a sign-in prompt for Chrome. No branches or loops are present as this is a single navigation step to the new tab interface.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <New tab option> (check if the new tab page still appears or if the app stays on the original page)
 - V2: Click <New tab option> twice (see if the app opens two new tab pages or behaves unexpectedly, e.g., crashes or shows an error)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[58] =================
[Function] New incognito tab option

 - V1: Tap <New incognito tab option> twice
 - V2: Omit tapping <New incognito tab option> (simulate not starting the incognito tab opening)
 - V3: Tap <New incognito tab option> after a short delay (simulate a timing variation)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[59] =================
[Function] Bookmarks option

[Core Logic Task]
The user initiates the process on page 42. The core action is clicking the 'Bookmarks' option, which is the only step in this flow as it directly interacts with the bookmarks functionality (with no further branching or looping shown in the provided actions).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Bookmarks option> (to see if the bookmarks functionality is still accessible without this action, though per core logic it's the only step so this is a mutation test)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Bookmarks option> (to check if repeated clicks have any unexpected behavior like multiple triggers or errors)
 - V3: Click <Bookmarks option> on a different page (simulating a user error of not starting on page 42, but since the widget is just <Bookmarks option> and no page navigation widget is given, this is a stretch but assuming page context can be changed, click <Bookmarks option> on page 43 instead of 42)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[60] =================
[Function] Recent tabs option
