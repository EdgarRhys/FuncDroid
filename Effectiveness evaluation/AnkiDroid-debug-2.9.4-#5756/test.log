[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Statistics page. They click on the REVIEW TIME tab, but since the goal is to view the REVIEW COUNT tab's graph (which is already active in the screenshot context, but the action here is the click on REVIEW TIME—though the core logic for REVIEW COUNT is that the graph is displayed on the REVIEW COUNT tab with card type categories and a cumulative axis, and the action here is a click on REVIEW TIME, but the main flow for REVIEW COUNT is that the tab is active and the graph is shown. Wait, the given action is click on REVIEW TIME, but the functional point is about REVIEW COUNT. Maybe the action is a mistake, but following the given action: The user is on the Statistics page (entry page 21), clicks the REVIEW TIME tab (action_ref [21,0]), and stays on page 21 (dst_page_idx 21). The core logic for the REVIEW COUNT tab's graph is that it displays answer counts by card type over -30 to 0 days with a cumulative axis, but the given action is for REVIEW TIME. However, following the provided action: The user starts at page 21 (Statistics), clicks the REVIEW TIME tab (action), and remains on page 21. Since there's only one action, the flow is a single step with no branches.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the AnkiDroid Advanced settings page. They click the 'Third-party API apps' option, which triggers a browser selection dialog to appear, offering Chrome or WebView Browser Tester as options to open the related content.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Third-party API apps option> and then immediately tap it again (repeat the tap operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Third-party API apps option> (though this would not trigger the browser selection as per normal flow, but it's a mutation of omitting the step)
 - V3: Tap <Third-party API apps option> and then, if there were other independent steps (but in this case, after tapping, the dialog appears; so swap with a non - existent step, but since only this widget, maybe consider a different interpretation: Tap <Third-party API apps option> and then, in the dialog (even though dialog widgets aren't in the list, assume a mutation: instead of choosing Chrome or WebView, do nothing, but that's a repeat/omit of the selection step. However, following the rules, the best we can do is: Tap <Third-party API apps option> and then tap it again (repeat), Omit tapping <Third-party API apps option>, and Tap <Third-party API apps option> and then try to interact with a non - existent widget (but since we can't, we'll adjust. So the three variants are as above).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Start on the Statistics page, omit clicking the <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> and check if the graph is still displayed (though core logic says it should be on page 115 after click, so this is a mutation to test omission)
 - V2: Start on the Statistics page, click the <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> twice in a row (repeat the click operation) and observe the graph rendering
 - V3: Start on a page other than Statistics (if possible, though widget descriptions don't mention navigation to Statistics, but assume we start on Statistics as per core logic, then swap the order: click the <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> first, then 'start' on Statistics (not really swappable, but adjust: Start on page 115 (where ANSWER BUTTONS tab is active), then click the <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> (the second one) and see if it's same as core logic's re - render)

[Function] The current page in AnkiDroid's Statistics section, under the WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab, displays a graph to visualize the percentage of correct answers and the number of reviews (answers) per day of the week, allowing users to analyze their study performance on a weekly basis.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Statistics page (page 115). They click the 'WEEKLY BREAKDOWN' tab, which navigates to the tab's page (page 112) displaying the weekly performance graph. This is a straight-line flow with no branches or loops.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab> and check if the weekly graph still appears (though expected to fail as per core logic)
 - V2: Click <WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab> twice (repeat the action to see if it causes any unexpected behavior like reloading or error)
 - V3: Click <WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab> and then immediately click it again (order mutation with repetition, same as above but emphasizing order of repeated click)

[Function] The current page in the AnkiDroid app's Statistics section, under the "CARD TYPES" tab, visualizes the distribution of different card types (Mature, Young+Learn, Unseen, Suspended+Buried) as a pie chart to show the proportion of each category within the selected deck (deck "111" here).

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Statistics page of deck '111'. They click the 'CARD TYPES' tab, which navigates to the page displaying the pie chart (and legend) for card type distribution (Mature, Young+Learn, Unseen, Suspended+Buried) in the selected deck. There are no branches or loops in this flow.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit tapping <CARD TYPES tab> and check if the pie chart still appears (though likely not, testing the dependency)
 - V2: Tap <CARD TYPES tab> twice in quick succession to see if the page reloads or behaves unexpectedly (repeat operation mutation)
