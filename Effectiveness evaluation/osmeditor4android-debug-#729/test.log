[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the help menu page (page 84) and clicks on the 'Multiselect' option (though the provided action is for 'Relation selected', assuming the flow to reach Multiselect help is via selecting it, then the Multiselect help page (page 90) is displayed, showing instructions for moving, selecting/deselecting elements, and detailing actions like Undo, Properties, Delete, Merge ways, Create relation, and Help for selected elements. Since only one action is provided, the flow is a single step to access the Multiselect help content.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Relation selected menu option> (to test if the help page still loads or if an error occurs)
 - V2: Click <Relation selected menu option> twice (to test if multiple clicks affect the help page display)
 - V3: Input special characters (e.g., '!@#$%') before clicking <Relation selected menu option> (though there's no input field, this is a stretch to test boundary conditions if an input was implied)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[68] =================
[Function] The page provides help documentation explaining the "New" mode in Vespucci for adding new nodes, ways, and OSM Notes, including the actions available in this mode and further actions like adding address tags, presets, OSM Notes, splitting ways, and setting names.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Creating new objects menu option> and stay on page 84
 - V2: Click <Creating new objects menu option> twice (repeat the navigation action)
 - V3: Attempt to click a non - existent menu option instead of <Creating new objects menu option> (branch mutation, though the non - existent option isn't in the widget list, this shows the intent of choosing an alternative, and since no other valid widgets are present, this is a way to mutate the branch choice)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[70] =================
[Function] The page provides help documentation for the "Advanced preferences" section, detailing various user interface settings (e.g., node icons, POI icons on buildings, tag form display, etc.) including their descriptions, default states, and functionality.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on page 84. The user clicks the 'Preferences' menu option (action_ref [84,8]), which navigates to page 92. On page 92, the 'Advanced preferences' help documentation is displayed, detailing UI settings like node icons, POI icons on buildings, and tag form display, along with their descriptions, default states, and functionality. There are no branches or loops as the logic is a straight-line navigation to view the help content.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Preferences menu option> and check if the help documentation still appears (repeat the original step of not clicking to see if the help is still accessible, which is an omit mutation)
 - V2: Click <Preferences menu option> twice (repeat mutation to see if the help documentation behaves differently with repeated navigation)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[71] =================
[Function] The current page provides help documentation for the "Align background" feature in the Vespucci app, explaining how to manually adjust background offsets, retrieve offsets from the imagery offset database, save offsets to the database, and listing all related functions for OpenStreetMap background alignment.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Help: Preferences page and clicks the 'Advanced preferences' menu option (though this seems misaligned; correcting, the actual flow is clicking 'Aligning background imag...' to access the Align background help. Wait, no—given the action provided is [84,9] (Advanced preferences), but the screenshots show the Align background help. Wait, the action given is: action_ref [84,9], src 84, dst 93, action click, description 'Advanced preferences menu option'. But the screenshots show the Align background help. Maybe a mistake, but following the action: The user is on page 84 (Help: Preferences), clicks the 'Advanced preferences' menu option (action [84,9]), navigating to page 93 (though the screenshot 2 is Align background, maybe the action is mislabeled? But per the given action, we proceed. So the step is: click Advanced preferences on page 84 to go to page 93. Since there's only one action, the flow is a single step. The logic: The user navigates from the Help: Preferences page by clicking the 'Advanced preferences' menu option, moving to the corresponding destination page (page 93).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Advanced preferences menu option> (staying on the Help: Preferences page instead of navigating)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Advanced preferences menu option> (though functionally it may have the same effect as a single click here, but as a mutation attempt)
 - V3: Click <Advanced preferences menu option> but with an invalid interaction context (e.g., simulating a click when the UI is in a state where the option isn't actually clickable, though this is more of a boundary case for interaction validity)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[72] =================
[Function] The page provides help documentation explaining how to resolve version and referential conflicts that occur during uploads in the Vespucci app, including guidance on handling conflicts related to modified, deleted, or referenced objects on the OpenStreetMap servers.
