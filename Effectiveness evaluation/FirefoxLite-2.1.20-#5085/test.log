On page 12, the list of open tabs (including problematic and active ones) is displayed, with options to close individual tabs (via 'X' buttons), add a new tab (via '+'), or close all tabs (via 'CLOSE ALL').

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Tabs button> (to test if the tab list page is accessible without this action, though likely it's required, but this is a mutation to check boundary of the flow)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Tabs button> multiple times (to see if it causes unexpected behavior like multiple navigations or errors)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[13] =================

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Tabs icon button> (test if the tab management view is accessible without this action)
 - V2: Click <Tabs icon button> twice (test repeated interaction with the Tabs icon button)
 - V3: Click <Tabs icon button> then immediately click it again (test repeated navigation via Tabs icon button)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[15] =================
[Function] Search input field

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 6 and performs a click action on the search input field, which navigates to page 24. This is a straightforward flow with no branches or loops.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Search input field> (check if navigation still occurs, though core logic says it should navigate on tap, so this tests the necessity of the tap)
 - V2: Tap <Search input field> twice (test if repeated tap causes unexpected behavior like multiple navigations or errors)
 - V3: Tap <Search input field> but expect navigation to a different page (branch mutation: assume an alternative navigation target, though original is page 24, this tests if the app handles incorrect expectations or has hidden branches)

On page 25, the detailed breakdown of 8 memory leaks in MainActivity.mViewModelStore is displayed, including involved classes, leak status, and specific leaking elements. There are no branches or loops as the logic is a straight-line navigation to view the leak details.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <My shots icon> and check if the leak details page (page 25) still loads (repeat/omit mutation: omit the navigation step)
 - V2: Tap <My shots icon> twice in a row and observe if the leak details page (page 25) loads correctly or if there are any issues (repeat/omit mutation: repeat the navigation step)

 - V2: Click <History button> multiple times (e.g., twice) and observe if the detailed memory leak information about MainActivity.mDialogFragment is affected or repeated
 - V3: Try clicking a non - existent button (but since we can only use <History button>, this is a mutation in the sense of violating the normal flow by not using the correct widget, but in our case, we can represent it as: Attempt to navigate to the detailed memory leak page without clicking <History button> (to test the dependency on this button))

================= [TaskTest] FDG[53] =================
