[Function] Track and manage daily activities

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the activity diary page (page 0). They perform a click action on the 'Woodworking' activity tag, which remains on the same page (page 0). This action likely tracks or manages the Woodworking activity, with no branching logic as only one action is present.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Woodworking activity tag> twice (repeat the action)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Woodworking activity tag> (skip the tracking action)
 - V3: Tap <Woodworking activity tag> and then tap it again (order doesn't change but repeat, same as first but explicit order)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[1] =================
[Function] The current page (a side menu) in the Activity Diary app provides navigation options to select an activity, view the diary, add or edit activities, access settings, and learn about the app, enabling users to manage and navigate through different features related to tracking daily activities.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the main page (page 0). The user clicks the hamburger menu icon (action S1), which opens the side menu (page 1) with navigation options. From here, the user can choose to navigate to different features like selecting an activity, viewing the diary, adding/editing activities, accessing settings, or learning about the app, but the core step here is opening the side menu via the hamburger icon click.

[Variant Paths] (0)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[2] =================
[Function] The current page allows users to search for specific daily activities within the Activity Diary app, enabling them to locate and potentially manage or view details of tracked activities.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the main Activity Diary page. They click the search icon (at position [864, 124]) to initiate the search functionality for daily activities. This action likely opens a search input or interface to locate specific tracked activities.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Search icon> (test if app allows search without initiating via this icon, though likely fails but is a mutation)
 - V2: Tap <Search icon> twice (repeat the action to see if it causes unexpected behavior like multiple search interfaces or errors)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[3] =================
[Function] This page allows the user to edit the title and color of a daily activity (specifically "Woodworking") and provides options to save, delete, or cancel the changes.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts by clicking the plus icon to add or edit the 'Woodworking' activity (step S1). Then, they can edit the activity title via the input field (S2) or adjust the activity color using the color selection bar (S3). For color adjustment, sliders for red, green, and blue can be modified (S4, S5, S6), and the color selection is confirmed (S7). Finally, the user can save the changes (S8), delete the activity (not shown in steps), or cancel (S9).

[Variant Paths] (5)
 - V1: Tap <Plus icon for adding activity>, then immediately Tap <Save activity button> (omit editing title/color)
 - V2: Tap <Plus icon for adding activity>, Input "" into <Activity Title input field>, then Tap <Save activity button> (empty title input)
 - V3: Tap <Plus icon for adding activity>, Tap <Activity Color selection bar>, Tap <SELECT confirmation button>, then Tap <Save activity button> (skip color sliders)
 - V4: Tap <Plus icon for adding activity>, Tap <Red color adjustment slider>, Tap <Green color adjustment slider>, Tap <Blue color adjustment slider>, Tap <SELECT confirmation button>, then Tap <Close new activity button> (cancel after color adjustment instead of save)
 - V5: Tap <Plus icon for adding activity>, Tap <Green color adjustment slider>, Tap <Red color adjustment slider>, Tap <Blue color adjustment slider>, Tap <SELECT confirmation button>, then Tap <Save activity button> (swap red and green slider order)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[4] =================
[Function] This page functions as a camera interface (likely for augmented reality or activity - related photo capture) that is accessed from the daily activity tracking and management page, enabling users to take photos or record videos, possibly for documenting activities or for AR - related tasks.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the activity diary page (page 0). They click the camera button, which navigates to the camera interface (page 3) for photo/video capture related to activities. The flow is a straight line with no branches or loops here.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Camera button> twice (repeat the operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Camera button> (skip the navigation to camera interface)
 - V3: Tap <Camera button> after a very long delay (simulate a delayed interaction, though the action is still tapping the same widget)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[5] =================
[Function] The current page (a "Note" dialog) allows the user to input a note related to a daily activity (accessed via the edit button from the activity tracking page) and either confirm the input with "OK" or cancel the action with "CANCEL".

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts by clicking the Edit button on the activity tracking page to open the Note dialog. Then, the user can either input text in the note field or click the CANCEL button to exit the dialog without saving. If inputting, the flow proceeds to the input step; if canceling, it returns to the activity page.

[Variant Paths] (5)
 - V1: Tap <Edit button> to open the Note dialog, then tap <CANCEL button> without interacting with <Note text input field>
 - V2: Tap <Edit button> to open the Note dialog, input an empty string into <Note text input field>, then tap <OK> (instead of canceling)
 - V3: Tap <Edit button> to open the Note dialog, input a very long string (e.g., 1000 repeated 'a's) into <Note text input field>, then tap <OK>
 - V4: Tap <Edit button> to open the Note dialog, input special characters (e.g., '!@#$%^&*()') into <Note text input field>, then tap <OK>
 - V5: Tap <Edit button> to open the Note dialog, tap <OK> immediately without inputting anything (omitting the input step)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[6] =================
[Function] The current page of the Activity Diary Debug app allows users to track and manage daily activities by displaying a current activity (Woodworking with a 7-minute duration) and providing options to select from a list of predefined activities (e.g., Cinema, Swimming, Sleeping) or use camera/editing features.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 1 (menu open) and clicks the 'Select Activity' menu option. This action navigates to page 0, where the current activity (Woodworking, 7 min) and a list of predefined activities (e.g., Cinema, Swimming) are displayed, along with camera/edit options. The flow is a single step with navigation, no branches yet.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Select Activity menu option> (check if app still navigates or shows activity list without interaction)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Select Activity menu option> multiple times (check for repeated navigation or errors)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[7] =================
[Function] The Diary page displays a list of daily activities with their respective timestamps and durations, allowing users to view and track their activity history.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 1 and clicks the 'Diary' menu option (action_ref [1,1]). This action navigates to page 5, where the Diary page displays a list of daily activities with their timestamps and durations, allowing the user to view and track their activity history. There are no further branches or loops as the goal is to reach and display the Diary page content.

[Variant Paths] (5)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Diary menu option> and check if the Diary page still loads (though this may not be valid as per core logic, but for mutation testing)
 - V2: Click <Diary menu option> twice (repeat the action to see if it causes any issues like multiple navigations or errors)
 - V3: Attempt to navigate to the Diary page without clicking <Diary menu option> (simulating a bypass of the intended navigation step)
 - V4: Click <Diary menu option> and then immediately click it again (testing rapid repeated interaction with the navigation widget)
 - V5: Wait for a short period (e.g., 5 seconds) and then click <Diary menu option> (testing delayed interaction with the navigation widget)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[8] =================
[Function] The current page allows users to edit or add a new activity by specifying the activity title and selecting an activity color, with options to save, delete, or cancel the changes.

[Core Logic Task]
The process starts on page 1, where the user clicks the 'Add Activity' menu option. This action navigates to page 2, which is the activity editing interface where the user can specify the activity title and color, and choose to save, delete, or cancel changes.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Add Activity menu option> (simulate not starting the add/edit process)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Add Activity menu option> (simulate multiple attempts to start the process)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[9] =================
[Function] The "Manage Activities" page allows users to view, edit, and potentially add (via the '+' icon) different types of daily activities (e.g., Cinema, Cleaning, Cooking) for the purpose of tracking and managing their daily routines.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 1 and clicks the 'Edit Activities' menu option. This action navigates them to page 6, the 'Manage Activities' page, where they can view, edit, or add daily activities.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Edit Activities menu option> (to test if the app still navigates to Manage Activities page without this action, though likely it won't, but it's a mutation of omitting the step)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Edit Activities menu option> (to test if multiple clicks cause unexpected behavior like multiple navigations or errors)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[10] =================
[Function] The Settings page for the Activity Diary app allows users to configure various options including date format, activity selection behavior, crash reporting, image storage and metadata, and conditions for activity sorting and sequencing.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts by clicking the Settings menu option to enter the Settings page. From there, users can click on 'Alphabetical Sort info' or 'Activity Sequence info' (though the latter leads to a configuration dialog). In the Activity Sequence dialog, users can select a radio button (OFF, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50) to set the sequence weight or click CANCEL to return to the Settings page.

[Variant Paths] (5)
 - V1: Tap <Settings menu option>, Tap <Alphabetical Sort info> (instead of Activity Sequence info)
 - V2: Tap <Settings menu option>, Tap <Activity Sequence info>, Tap <OFF radio button> (selecting OFF instead of other weights)
 - V3: Tap <Settings menu option>, Tap <Activity Sequence info>, Tap <50 radio button> (selecting maximum weight instead of a smaller one)
 - V4: Tap <Settings menu option>, Tap <Activity Sequence info>, Tap <CANCEL button> immediately (omitting radio button selection)
 - V5: Tap <Settings menu option>, Tap <Activity Sequence info>, Tap <10 radio button>, Tap <10 radio button> (repeating radio button selection)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[11] =================
[Function] The "About" page of the Activity Diary Debug app provides information about the app's version, a brief description of its functionality, details about its open - source license (GNU General Public License), and contact information for reporting bugs and suggesting improvements.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on page 1. First, the 'About' menu option is clicked, navigating to page 8 (the About page). Then, the back navigation button on page 8 is clicked, returning to page 0. There are no branches or loops in this flow.

[Variant Paths] (4)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Back navigation button> after navigating to the About page
 - V2: Click <Back navigation button> first and then click <About menu option>
 - V3: Click <About menu option> twice in a row and then click <Back navigation button>
 - V4: Navigate to the About page, then click <Back navigation button> twice (though the second click may have no effect as we might already be on the initial page)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[12] =================
[Function] The page functions as a dashboard for tracking and managing daily activities, displaying a current activity (Woodworking) with its duration, providing quick access to common activity categories (e.g., Cinema, Swimming, Sleeping), and offering options to add (via the plus icon), search (via the search icon), or edit/attach media to the current activity (via the pencil and camera icons).

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the activity details page (page 2) for 'Woodworking'. They click the delete activity button (trash icon), which navigates them back to the main dashboard (page 0) where the 'Woodworking' activity is no longer displayed (or its state is updated).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Delete activity button> and check if 'Woodworking' activity still appears on the main dashboard
 - V2: Click <Delete activity button> twice and check the result
 - V3: Click <Delete activity button> and then immediately click it again without waiting for the page to load

================= [TaskTest] FDG[13] =================
[Function] The page functions as the main interface of the Activity Diary app, allowing users to track and manage daily activities by selecting from predefined activity categories, viewing details of a current activity (Woodworking with a 7 - minute duration), and accessing options to add (via the '+' button), search (via the search button), or edit/attach media to the activity (via the pencil and camera buttons).

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 4 (with a 'Note' dialog open). They click the OK button in the dialog, which navigates them to page 0 (the main activity diary interface showing 'Woodworking' with a 7 - minute duration and activity categories).

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <OK button> and see if the app navigates to page 0 automatically
 - V2: Click <OK button> multiple times (e.g., twice) to see if there's any unexpected behavior
