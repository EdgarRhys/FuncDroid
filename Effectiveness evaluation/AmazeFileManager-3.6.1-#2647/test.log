================= [TaskTest] FDG[1] =================
[Function] The current page is a navigation menu in a file manager app, providing options to access different storage locations, quick access sections, server management, app management, and settings.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the main file manager page (page 0). The user clicks the navigation menu button, which opens the navigation menu (page 1) containing options for storage, quick access, server management, app management, and settings. This is a straight - line flow with no branches or loops as only one action is provided.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Open navigation menu,Navigation menu for file management> twice (repeat operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Open navigation menu,Navigation menu for file management> (omit step)
 - V3: Tap <Open navigation menu,Navigation menu for file management> and then immediately tap it again (order mutation with repeat)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[2] =================
[Function] The current page provides a file and folder search interface within the "/storage/emulated/0" directory, allowing users to search for specific files or folders among the listed 13 folders and 32 files, and also enabling navigation back or clearing the search, along with options to interact with each folder via the three - dot menu and a button to add new items.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the main directory page (page 0). First, the user clicks the search button to enter the file/folder search interface (page 2). Then, the user clicks the search input field to begin typing a search query. There are no branches as the actions form a linear sequence to access the search functionality.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit the step of clicking <Search input field> after entering the <Search files/folders,File and folder search interface>
 - V2: Input an extremely long string (e.g., a string with 1000 characters) into the <Search input field> after entering the <Search files/folders,File and folder search interface>
 - V3: Input special characters (e.g., @#$%) into the <Search input field> after entering the <Search files/folders,File and folder search interface>

================= [TaskTest] FDG[3] =================
[Function] The current page in the Amaze file manager app displays the contents of the home directory ("/storage/emulated/0"), showing a list of folders (e.g., Alarms, Android, DCIM) with their modification dates and options for additional actions, allowing users to browse, manage, and access files and directories within the home storage.

[Core Logic Task]
The app starts at the home directory page ("/storage/emulated/0"). When the "Go to home directory" action is triggered (e.g., by clicking the home icon), the app navigates (or refreshes) to display the home directory's contents, including folders with modification dates and action options. This is a single step as the flow is to reach and display the home directory's file structure.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit triggering <Go to home directory> and check if the app still displays the home directory (repeat/omit mutation: omit the trigger step)
 - V2: Trigger <Go to home directory> twice in a row and observe if the app navigates/refreshes the home directory each time (repeat/omit mutation: repeat the trigger step)
 - V3: Wait for a while and then trigger <Go to home directory> to see if the app's behavior changes with a time delay before the trigger (order mutation: introduce a delay before the trigger step, though the core step is still triggering <Go to home directory>)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[4] =================
[Function] The current page's more options menu in the file manager provides additional actions such as sorting, viewing history, switching to grid view, setting the current directory as home, or exiting the app.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts by clicking the more options menu in the file manager (page 0). After opening the menu, a branch point appears where the user can choose to click the 'Sort' option (leading to page 83) or other available options (not shown here).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <More options menu,More options menu for file manager> and then omit clicking <Sort option,Sorting options submenu> (explore other unshown options implicitly)
 - V2: Tap <More options menu,More options menu for file manager> twice (repeat opening the menu) and then click <Sort option,Sorting options submenu>
 - V3: Tap <Sort option,Sorting options submenu> without first tapping <More options menu,More options menu for file manager> (invalid flow mutation to test error handling)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[5] =================
[Function] The current page in the Amaze file manager app displays a list of folders within the "/storage/emulated/0" directory and provides a context menu with operations (Cut, Copy, Delete, Rename, Encrypt, Properties, Add to Bookmark) for managing a selected folder.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the folder list page of /storage/emulated/0. A click on a folder's options menu (three dots) opens a context menu with operations like Cut, Copy, Delete, Rename, Encrypt, Properties, and Add to Bookmark. This is a single step with no branching as the action just reveals the menu options.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Long - press <Folder options menu> instead of tapping it to open the context menu
 - V2: Tap <Folder operation options menu> multiple times (repeat the tap operation) to see if the context menu behavior changes
 - V3: Omit tapping <Folder options menu> and check if the context menu appears by some other implicit action (though this is less likely, but for mutation testing, we consider this omission)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[6] =================
[Function] The current page in the Amaze file manager app provides options to create a new folder, a new file, or set up a cloud connection within the /storage/emulated/0 directory, while also displaying existing folders and files in that directory.

The user clicks the 'Create new item' menu (from the pink '+' button), which opens a submenu with options to create a folder, a file, or set up a cloud connection. The flow then branches based on which option the user selects from this submenu.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Create new item,Create new item options menu> and immediately close it without selecting any option
 - V2: Tap <Create new item,Create new item options menu> twice in quick succession
 - V3: Omit interacting with <Create new item,Create new item options menu> and instead try to navigate away from the /storage/emulated/0 directory

================= [TaskTest] FDG[7] =================
[Function] The current page in the Amaze file manager app displays the contents (folders and files) of the "/storage/emulated/0" directory, allowing users to browse, manage (via the three - dot menu for each item), and potentially create new items (via the plus button) within this storage location.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 1 (navigation menu) and clicks the 'Storage' navigation item. This action navigates to page 0, which displays the contents of the "/storage/emulated/0" directory, enabling file/folder browsing, management via three - dot menus, or new item creation via the plus button.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Storage navigation item> (to test if navigation to page 0 still occurs without this action)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Storage navigation item> multiple times (to test if repeated navigation causes unexpected behavior)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[8] =================
[Function] The current page in the Amaze file manager app displays the contents (folders) of the "/storage/0000-0000" directory, allowing users to browse, manage (via the three - dot menu on each folder), and potentially create new items (via the plus button) within this specific storage location.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the main storage navigation page. They click the '0000-0000' navigation item to browse the folders within the '/storage/0000-0000' directory, transitioning to the page displaying its contents (folders like Android and LOST.DIR) for further management or creation actions.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <0000-0000 navigation item,Browse storage folders> and attempt to manage folders without navigating to the directory
 - V2: Tap <0000-0000 navigation item,Browse storage folders> twice in a row to see if repeated navigation has an effect
 - V3: Tap <0000-0000 navigation item,Browse storage folders> and then immediately tap it again before the page fully loads

================= [TaskTest] FDG[9] =================

================= [TaskTest] FDG[22] =================
[Function] Set As Home option

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 3 (a file manager interface with a menu open). The core action is clicking the 'Set As Home' option in the menu, which navigates to page 86. There are no branches or loops as this is a single, direct action to set the home location.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Set As Home option> and check if navigation to page 86 still occurs (though expected to fail as per core logic)
 - V2: Tap <Set As Home option> twice (repeat the action to see if it causes any unexpected behavior like multiple navigations or errors)
 - V3: Try to navigate to page 86 without tapping <Set As Home option> (to test if the navigation is solely dependent on this action)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[23] =================
[Function] Exit option

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 3 (a file manager interface). The core logic is a single step: clicking the 'Exit' option (from the dropdown menu) to navigate to page 87, likely exiting the app or returning to a previous state. There are no branches or loops as it’s a direct action.

[Variant Paths] (0)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[24] =================
[Function] Cut folder

[Core Logic Task]
The process starts on page 4 (a file manager view). The user performs a click action to select the 'Cut folder' option, which transitions the flow to page 91. This single step completes the core action of initiating the cut operation for the folder.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Cut folder> twice (repeat operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Cut folder> (skip the core action)
 - V3: Tap <Cut folder> after a 10-second delay (simulate timing variation, though widget interaction is still just tapping it)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[25] =================
[Function] Copy folder

[Core Logic Task]
The core execution logic for copying a folder starts on page 4. The user performs a click action to initiate the copy folder operation, transitioning to page 92. This is a straight-line flow with no branches or loops as only one action is involved.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Copy folder> (test if the operation still proceeds without initiation)
 - V2: Repeat tapping <Copy folder> (test if multiple initiations cause issues)
 - V3: Tap <Copy folder> twice in quick succession (test for unexpected behavior from repeated initiation)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[26] =================
[Function] Delete folder

[Core Logic Task]
The core execution logic for deleting a folder starts at page 4. The user clicks the 'Delete folder' option, which transitions the flow to page 93, completing the deletion action.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit the step of clicking <Delete folder> (intended to see if deletion occurs without triggering the action)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Delete folder> multiple times (to check for unexpected behavior like multiple deletions or errors)
 - V3: Click <Delete folder> in a different order (though there's only one step here, this is a stretch to meet order mutation by considering if there were other steps, but in this case, just re-express the action as a mutation attempt)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[27] =================
[Function] The current page (dialog) allows the user to enter a name for a new file and provides options to either cancel the operation or create the new file with the entered name.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts by clicking to open the rename dialog (or new file dialog). Then, the user can either input the new name in the text field or choose to save (create) the file with the entered name. There's a branch at the dialog step where the user can decide to cancel (implicitly by not proceeding) or proceed to create the file after entering the name.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Save renamed folder> without inputting into <Text input for new folder name>
 - V2: Input a very long string (e.g., 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa') into <Text input for new folder name> then Tap <Save renamed folder>
 - V3: Tap <Rename folder,Rename folder dialog> again after already opening it (repeat the open dialog step)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[29] =================
[Function] The current page displays the properties of the "Alarms" folder, including its name, location, size, date, and a visual representation of storage usage (total, used, free space) within the parent directory.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit step: Do not click <Close properties dialog> after viewing folder properties using <View folder properties,View folder properties>
 - V2: Repeat step: Click <View folder properties,View folder properties> twice and then click <Close properties dialog>
 - V3: Order mutation (not applicable here as only two steps and second is dependent on first, so alternative: Click <View folder properties,View folder properties> and then immediately click <View folder properties,View folder properties> again before clicking <Close properties dialog>)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[30] =================
[Function] Add to Bookmark

[Core Logic Task]
The core execution logic for 'Add to Bookmark' starts on page 4. The user performs a click action on the 'Add to Bookmark' option, which transitions the flow to page 96. There are no branches or loops as it is a single-step action to add the item to bookmarks.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit the step: Do not tap <Add to Bookmark> and check if the item is still added to bookmarks (though this is against the normal flow, testing the system's reaction to omitted action)
 - V2: Repeat the step: Tap <Add to Bookmark> twice and check if the item is added multiple times or if there's an error handling duplicate adds
 - V3: Boundary case (though no input, but check if the action still works as expected when maybe the item state is at a boundary, like already bookmarked: Tap <Add to Bookmark> when the item is already bookmarked to see the system's reaction)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[31] =================
[Function] This page (a dialog in a file manager app) allows the user to enter a name for a new folder (or file, based on the dialog title "New File" but the context from the path was creating a new folder) and then either cancel the operation or create the new item with the entered name.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the file manager page (page 5) and clicks the 'Create new folder' button. This action opens a 'New File' dialog (page 94) where the user can enter a name for the new item, then choose to cancel or create it. The core flow begins with the initial click to open the dialog.
