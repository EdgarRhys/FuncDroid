[Core Logic Task]
The file selection dialog is entered (page 94). The user can click the search icon (action) to potentially search for files/folders. Since there's one action here, the flow is a single step with the search icon interaction, and no branches/loops shown yet (but the dialog allows browsing/selecting items, which may involve further interactions not listed here).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Search icon> and directly try to browse files/folders (since the core flow had the search action, omitting it is a mutation)
 - V2: Tap <Search icon> multiple times (e.g., twice) instead of once
 - V3: Tap <Search icon> and then immediately tap it again (repeating the action)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[87] =================
