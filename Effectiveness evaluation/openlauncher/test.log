[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <SetWallpaper option> twice
 - V2: Omit tapping <SetWallpaper option> (though this would not navigate, but it's a mutation of omitting the step)
 - V3: Tap <SetWallpaper option> after a short delay (timing mutation, though UI interaction timing is a mutation type here)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[46] =================
[Function] LockScreen option

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on page 13 (Minibar settings). The user clicks on the 'LockScreen' option, which navigates to page 21. This is a straight - line flow with no branches or loops as there's only one action here.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <LockScreen option> and check if navigation to page 21 still occurs (though expected to fail as per core logic)
 - V2: Tap <LockScreen option> twice in a row and observe if it navigates to page 21 both times or has a different behavior
 - V3: Tap a non - existent option (but since only <LockScreen option> is available, this is a mutation of not using the correct widget, so try to tap an imaginary option similar in name like 'LockScreen1 option' which is not present, to see the error handling)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[47] =================
[Function] ClearRam option

[Core Logic Task]

================= [TaskTest] FDG[54] =================
[Function] This page allows the user to select the "API Demos" app (along with other listed apps) to be hidden, as part of the app's hide apps functionality accessed through the icons settings in the app's customization settings.

[Core Logic Task]
The user is on the 'Hide apps' page. The core logic involves interacting with app entries (like Calendar here) to mark them for hiding. This step is part of selecting apps to be hidden, with the action being a click on the Calendar app entry to include it in the hidden apps list (or mark it for hiding).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Calendar app entry> twice (repeat the tap operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Calendar app entry> (skip the step of marking Calendar for hiding)
 - V3: Tap <Calendar app entry> with a long-press instead of a normal tap (alternative interaction)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[55] =================
[Function] This page functions as an app selection interface for hiding apps, allowing the user to choose the "API Demos" app (along with other listed apps) to be hidden from view, with a confirmation action available via the checkmark button.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the 'Hide apps' page. They click on the 'Camera' app entry. Since there's only one action provided, the flow is a single step with no branches or loops, focusing on selecting the Camera app (or a similar app) for hiding, with the checkmark button available for confirmation (though the confirmation step isn't in the provided actions).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Camera app entry> twice (repeat selection)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Camera app entry> (try confirming without selection, though likely invalid but for mutation)
 - V3: Tap <Camera app entry> (original, included for completeness)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[56] =================
[Function] This page lists installed apps (e.g., API Demos, ATX, Calculator) to allow the user to select which apps to hide as part of the app's icon customization settings.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the 'Hide apps' page (page 79). The core logic involves interacting with app entries (like 'Custom Locale') to select them for hiding. The flow begins with a click on an app entry (e.g., 'Custom Locale'), and since the action is a leaf (no further navigation), the step completes the interaction for that app. There are no branches or loops here as the action is a single click on a specific app entry.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Custom Locale app entry> twice (repeat the tap operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Custom Locale app entry> (skip the selection step)
 - V3: Tap <Custom Locale app entry> and then tap it again (repeat the selection action)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[57] =================
[Function] The current page functions as an "All Apps" screen, displaying a grid of application icons for easy access to various installed apps on the device.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the home page (page 80). First, the 'All Apps' button is clicked, navigating to the 'All Apps' screen (page 81). Then, the 'Drive' app icon is clicked, which navigates to the Drive app's page (page 14). There are no branches or loops in this flow.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Start on the home page (page 80). Omit clicking <All Apps button>, directly click <Drive app icon> (invalid flow mutation to test if app navigation enforces All Apps first)
 - V2: Start on the home page (page 80). Click <All Apps button>, then click <Drive app icon> twice (repeat mutation)
 - V3: Start on the home page (page 80). Click <Drive app icon> first, then click <All Apps button> (order mutation)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[58] =================
[Function] Gallery app icon

[Core Logic Task]
The user initiates interaction with the Gallery app by clicking its icon. This action is the sole step in the flow, as the click on the Gallery icon (located at the specified position) is the core execution logic for accessing the app's functionality from the home screen.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Gallery app icon> twice (repeat the tap operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Gallery app icon> (try to access the app without tapping the icon, though this is an invalid flow but a mutation test case)
 - V3: Long-press <Gallery app icon> instead of tapping (branch mutation: use a different interaction type with the same widget)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[59] =================
[Function] Gestures Bu.. app icon

[Variant Paths] (0)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[61] =================
[Function] Google app icon

[Core Logic Task]
The core execution logic involves a single step: clicking the Google app icon. This action is performed on the entry page (page 81), and there are no subsequent steps or branch points as the action’s destination is null (indicating it may open the app or trigger a related UI change).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Google app icon> twice (repeat operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Google app icon> (omit step)
 - V3: Long-press <Google app icon> instead of tapping (branch mutation: alternative interaction)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[62] =================
[Function] Hangouts app icon

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the app grid page (page 81). The user performs a click action on the Hangouts app icon. Since this is a leaf action (is_leaf is false, but the flow here is a single step of clicking the icon), the core logic is the click on the Hangouts app icon from the app grid.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Long - press <Hangouts app icon> (instead of tap)
 - V2: Tap <Hangouts app icon> twice (repeat the tap operation)
 - V3: Omit tapping <Hangouts app icon> (skip the core action)

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Long-press <Maps app icon> (instead of single click)
 - V2: Tap <Maps app icon> twice (repeating the tap)
 - V3: Omit tapping <Maps app icon> (though this skips the core action, for mutation testing)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[64] =================
[Function] Messenger app icon

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the app grid page (page 81). The user performs a click action on the Messenger app icon. Since this is a leaf action (is_leaf: false? Wait, the action's is_leaf is false, but maybe it's the start. The core logic is clicking the Messenger app icon on the app grid to initiate interaction with the Messenger app (though the dst is null here, maybe indicating the start of the app's launch flow).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Long-press <Messenger app icon> (instead of tap)
 - V2: Tap <Messenger app icon> twice (repeat the tap)
 - V3: Omit tapping <Messenger app icon> (though this skips the core action, for mutation testing)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[65] =================
[Function] OLSettings app icon

[Core Logic Task]
The user initiates interaction with the OLSettings app by clicking its icon on the home screen. This action is the sole step in the flow, as the click is the core execution logic for accessing the app (or triggering its associated behavior) from this screen.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <OLSettings app icon> twice (repeat the tap operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <OLSettings app icon> (though this would mean not accessing the app, but as a mutation case)
 - V3: Tap <OLSettings app icon> with a long-press instead of a regular tap (branch mutation on the interaction type)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[66] =================
[Function] Phone app icon

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the app grid page (page 81). The user performs a click action on the Phone app icon, which is the only step here. Since the destination page is null (likely indicating the action triggers the app to open, but the flow for this functional point ends with the click), there are no further steps or branches.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Long-press <Phone app icon> (instead of click, to see if different behavior like app info appears)
 - V2: Tap <Phone app icon> twice (repeat the tap operation)
 - V3: Omit tapping <Phone app icon> (see if the app opens without interaction, though unlikely but for mutation)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[67] =================
[Function] Photos app icon

[Core Logic Task]
The user initiates interaction with the Photos app by clicking its icon on the home screen. This action is the sole step in the flow, as the click is intended to open the app (though the destination page is not yet loaded or is null in the action data).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Photos app icon> twice (repeat the tap operation)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Photos app icon> (though this would mean not initiating the app, but as a mutation case, it's considered)
 - V3: Long-press <Photos app icon> instead of tapping (branch mutation to use a different interaction type)
