 - V1: Omit clicking <Pick backup file manually> (since the core flow is just this click, omitting it is a mutation to see if the app behaves as expected without this action)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Pick backup file manually> (click it multiple times to check if the app handles repeated navigation attempts)

[Function] This page allows the user to rename (or name a new copy of) a workspace by entering a new name in the provided text field and confirming with "OK" or canceling with "CANCEL".

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the workspace selection page. They click the 'Rename' option (or equivalent for naming a new copy) from the workspace menu, which opens a dialog to enter a new workspace name. The dialog provides 'OK' to confirm the new name or 'CANCEL' to abort, though the initial step here is opening the renaming dialog via the click action.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Rename workspace> and immediately tap <CANCEL> without entering a name (omit input step)
 - V2: Tap <Rename workspace>, input an extremely long string (e.g., 1000 'a's) into the name field, then tap <OK>
 - V3: Tap <Rename workspace>, input an empty string into the name field, then tap <OK>

[Function] This page allows the user to rename (or name a new copy of) a workspace by entering a new name in the provided text field and confirming with "OK" or canceling the action with "CANCEL".

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the workspace selection page. They click 'Copy as new workspace' to open a dialog for naming the new workspace. The dialog shows a default name, and the user can then either confirm (OK) or cancel (CANCEL) the action, but the provided action only captures the initial click to open the dialog.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Copy as new workspace>, then immediately tap <CANCEL> (instead of considering OK, to mutate the confirmation choice)
 - V2: Tap <Copy as new workspace>, then tap <Copy as new workspace> again (repeating the dialog - opening action, a repeat mutation)
 - V3: Tap <Copy as new workspace>, then try to proceed without interacting with OK/CANCEL (omitting the confirmation step, though the app's behavior here is part of the mutation test)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[80] =================

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Toggle replace divine name> twice (first to toggle, second to revert, testing state change repeatability)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Toggle replace divine name> (testing if the default state is as expected without interaction)
 - V3: Tap <Toggle replace divine name> (original action, included as a base for comparison, though mutation here is about alternative interactions with the same widget in terms of repeat/omit/boundary which for a toggle is state changes)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[84] =================
