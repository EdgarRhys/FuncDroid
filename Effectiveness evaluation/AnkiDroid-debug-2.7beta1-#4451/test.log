 - V2: Click <Three-dot menu icon> twice (to test repeated interaction with the menu icon)
 - V3: Click <Three-dot menu icon> and then immediately click it again (to test rapid consecutive interactions with the menu icon)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[4] =================
[Function] This page in AnkiDroid displays a flashcard from the "Default" deck (with the deck '123' likely being the one in use, showing the front side of the card and providing a "SHOW ANSWER" option to reveal the back, while also tracking study time and progress metrics).

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the deck selection page. First, the user clicks on the deck named '123' (or the active deck) to enter the flashcard study view. Then, the user can click the 'SHOW ANSWER' button to reveal the back of the current flashcard, with the study view remaining the same after this action.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit step: Enter the flashcard study view by clicking <Deck named '123'>, directly try to click <SHOW ANSWER button> (test if the app handles invalid state gracefully)
 - V2: Repeat step: Click <Deck named '123'>, then click <SHOW ANSWER button>, then click <Deck named '123'> again (test if re-entering deck after showing answer has issues)
 - V3: Boundary input-like mutation (adapted for actions): Click <Deck named '123'>, then long-press (instead of tap) <SHOW ANSWER button> (test alternative interaction with the button)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[5] =================
[Function] This page in AnkiDroid displays a flashcard from the '123' deck for review, showing the front side of the card and providing an option to reveal the answer.

[Core Logic Task]
The process starts on the deck list page. The user clicks on the 'Default' deck (though the goal is the '123' deck, this action navigates to a deck's review page). On the review page, a flashcard front is shown, and there's an option to reveal the answer (implied by the 'SHOW ANSWER' button, though not in the given action yet). The flow is a straight line so far with the initial click to enter a deck's review.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Deck named 'Default'> twice (repeat the deck selection step)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Deck named 'Default'> (try to access the review page without selecting the deck)
 - V3: Tap <Deck named 'Default'> and then tap it again (repeat the deck selection action)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[6] =================
[Function] The current page in AnkiDroid's Card browser allows users to view, sort, and manage the flashcards within the "Default" deck, displaying card details like the sort field and lapse count, with options to add, search, or access more actions for the cards.

[Core Logic Task]

 - V3: Click <Settings menu item> and then immediately click it again (test for duplicate navigation or state change)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[12] =================
[Function] The current page is the AnkiWeb account login interface, which allows users to enter their email address and password to log in to their AnkiWeb account, with additional options to reset the password or sign up for a new account.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the AnkiWeb account login page (page 2). First, they can click the LOG IN button (action [2,1]) to proceed, but before that, they may interact with the email address input field (action [28,0]) or the password input field (action [28,1]) to enter credentials. After entering, clicking LOG IN attempts the login, with options to reset password or sign up also available.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <LOG IN button> without entering anything in <Email address input field> or <Password input field>
 - V2: Input a very long string (e.g., 1000 characters) into <Email address input field> and then tap <LOG IN button>
 - V3: Input a very long string (e.g., 1000 characters) into <Password input field> and then tap <LOG IN button>

================= [TaskTest] FDG[14] =================
[Function] The current page (dialog) asks the user whether to email the exported AnkiDroid collection.apkg file located at "/sdcard/AnkiDroid/export/".

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts with a click action (S1) on the 'Check database' option. After this action, a dialog appears asking whether to email the exported AnkiDroid collection.apkg file. At this point (S2, the dialog step), there is an if-else branch: the user can either choose to email the file (OK button, leading to S3) or cancel the email action (CANCEL button, leading to S4).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Check database option> twice (repeat S1)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Check database option> (skip S1, though this might not trigger the dialog as per core logic, but it's a mutation attempt)
 - V3: After tapping <Check database option>, immediately tap it again instead of interacting with the dialog (branch/order mutation by repeating S1 instead of proceeding to S2 choices)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[15] =================
[Function] The current page is a dialog box in AnkiDroid asking the user whether they want to email the exported "collection.apkg" file, with options to cancel or proceed by clicking OK.

[Core Logic Task]
The user is presented with a dialog asking whether to email the exported 'collection.apkg' file. The flow begins with a click action (Check media option) leading to the dialog. At the dialog, the user can choose to either cancel (branch 1) or proceed by clicking OK (branch 2) to email the file.

[Variant Paths] (0)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[16] =================
[Function] The current page (a dialog) asks the user whether to email the exported AnkiDroid collection.apkg file located at "/sdcard/AnkiDroid/export/".

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on page 3 (AnkiDroid main menu with options). The flow involves a click action (on 'Empty cards'? Wait, no—wait the functional point is about emailing the exported .apkg. Wait, the provided action is 'Empty cards option' click, but the screenshots show a dialog 'Email apkg?'. Wait, maybe the action is misaligned. Wait, the task is to extract the core logic for the dialog asking to email the exported file. Let's re-express: The dialog appears (entry page 2? Wait the action has src_page 3, dst_page 2. So step S1: click on an option (maybe 'Export collection' leads to the dialog). Wait, the provided action is [3,3] with src 3, dst 2, action click, description 'Empty cards option'—but the functional point is about emailing the exported file. Maybe there's a mistake, but following the given action: Step S1: click on 'Empty cards' (src page 3, dst page 2). Then, the next step would be the dialog? Wait, the second screenshot is page 2 (the dialog). So the logic: The user is on page 3 (AnkiDroid menu), clicks an option (S1: click 'Empty cards'? No, the functional point is emailing exported file. Wait, perhaps the action is part of a different flow, but the task is to use the given action. So: The flow starts at page 3. Step S1: click on the 'Empty cards' option (action_ref [3,3]), navigating to page 2. Then, on page 2 (the dialog), the user would have a branch: click OK to email or CANCEL. But the given action is only the first step. Wait, the provided actions list has one action. So the logic is: The user is on page 3 (AnkiDroid menu), clicks the 'Empty cards' option (step S1), which navigates to page 2 (possibly a dialog or another page). Since there's only one action, the flow is a single step, no branches (but the functional point's dialog is on page 2, so maybe the entry is page 2, but the action is from 3 to 2. So adjusting: entry_page 3, step S1: click 'Empty cards' (src 3, dst 2). The logic: The user starts on page 3, clicks the 'Empty cards' option, navigating to page 2. No further steps as only one action is provided. Wait, but the functional point is about emailing the exported file—maybe the action is a precursor. Alternatively, maybe the action is mislabeled, and the actual flow is: After exporting the collection, a dialog appears (page 2) asking to email the file. The user can choose OK (to email) or CANCEL. But the provided action is a click on 'Empty cards'—maybe the action is part of a different flow, but the task is to use the given action. So proceeding with the given action: The core logic is the user clicks on the 'Empty cards' option from page 3, navigating to page 2. No branches as only one action is present (but the functional point's dialog is on page 2, so maybe the next steps are implied but not in the actions list). But following the given action: The flow has one step: click on 'Empty cards' from page 3 to page 2.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Repeat the action: Tap <Empty cards option> again on page 3 (after first tap)
 - V2: Omit the action: Do not tap <Empty cards option> on page 3 (stay on page 3)
 - V3: Boundary case (if applicable, but no input here): Tap <Empty cards option> with no prior interaction (same as original but checking if it still works)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[17] =================
[Function] The current page (dialog) asks the user whether to email the exported AnkiDroid collection.apkg file located at "/sdcard/AnkiDroid/export/".

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on page 3 (AnkiDroid main menu with options). A click action (Restore from backup option) transitions to page 2, where a dialog appears asking whether to email the exported collection.apkg file. The core logic involves this transition to the dialog page, with the dialog presenting the email option decision point.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Restore from backup option> twice (repeat the transition step)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Restore from backup option> (skip the transition to the dialog page)
 - V3: Tap <Restore from backup option> and then immediately tap it again (order mutation with repeated step)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[18] =================
[Function] The "Manage note types" page in AnkiDroid allows users to view, organize, and potentially modify or create different note types (e.g., Basic, Cloze) used for creating flashcards, with a count of notes associated with each type.

[Core Logic Task]

 - V2: Repeat clicking <Manage note types option> twice in a row before attempting to go back with <Back arrow button>
 - V3: Click <Back arrow button> first and then <Manage note types option>

================= [TaskTest] FDG[19] =================
[Function] The current page (a dialog) asks the user whether to email the exported AnkiDroid collection.apkg file, providing options to cancel or confirm the action.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts at page 3. The user interacts with the dialog asking to email the exported collection.apkg file. The key step is a click action related to the import option (though the main logic here is about the email dialog's options, but based on the provided action, we capture the click step). The flow then transitions to page 2, with a branch point (not fully detailed here due to limited actions, but the core is the click action triggering a transition).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Import option> twice (repeat the click action)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Import option> (skip the key click step)
 - V3: Tap <Import option> in a different context (though context is limited, simulate alternative interaction timing)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[20] =================
[Function] The current page is a dialog in AnkiDroid that allows the user to configure and confirm the export of their flashcard collection as an apkg file, with options to include scheduling and media, and buttons to cancel or proceed with the export.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts by clicking 'Export collection' to open the export dialog. In the dialog, they can optionally toggle 'Include scheduling' and 'Include media' checkboxes. Then, they choose to either cancel the export (returning to the main page) or confirm it (proceeding to the export completion dialog).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Export collection option>, then omit toggling <Include scheduling checkbox> and <Include media checkbox>, directly tap <OK button>
 - V2: Tap <Export collection option>, toggle <Include media checkbox> but omit toggling <Include scheduling checkbox>, then tap <CANCEL button>
 - V3: Tap <Export collection option>, toggle <Include scheduling checkbox> and <Include media checkbox>, then tap <OK button> (original flow as a base, but here listed as a mutation to check if repeating toggles or order matters, though in this case order of toggles might not matter but included for completeness)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[21] =================
[Function] The current page (AnkiDroid sidebar menu) provides navigation options to access different features like Decks, Card browser, Statistics, Night mode toggle, Settings, Help, and Send feedback, allowing users to manage flashcard decks, browse cards, view stats, adjust settings, and access support/feedback options.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on the card browser page (page 5). The user clicks the hamburger menu button, which opens the AnkiDroid sidebar menu (page 10) containing navigation options like Decks, Card browser, Statistics, Night mode toggle, Settings, Help, and Send feedback. This single step initiates access to the sidebar's functional navigation.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Hamburger menu button> (test if sidebar opens without interaction, though likely invalid but for mutation)
 - V2: Tap <Hamburger menu button> twice (repeat interaction)
 - V3: Tap <Hamburger menu button> then immediately tap it again (order mutation with repeat)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[22] =================
[Function] The current page in the AnkiDroid app's card browser allows the user to select a specific flashcard deck (from options like "All decks", "123", "Default") to view or manage its cards, with the dropdown menu providing deck selection functionality.

[Core Logic Task]

 - V2: Omit tapping <Default deck dropdown> (stay with the initially selected 'Default' deck without interaction)
 - V3: Tap <Default deck dropdown> and then immediately tap it again (simulating repeated interaction)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[23] =================
[Function] The current page (a dialog box) asks the user to confirm whether to close the "Add note" interface and discard the currently entered flashcard information, with options to cancel the action or proceed with closing and losing the input.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts at the dialog asking to close and lose input. At the dialog, the user can choose to cancel (staying in the 'Add note' interface) or confirm (proceeding to close and lose the input). The branch is based on which button (CANCEL or OK) is clicked.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: At the dialog, tap <OK button> to confirm closing and losing input (original correct path, here as a base for mutations)
 - V2: At the dialog, tap <CANCEL button> to cancel closing (branch mutation, alternative option)
 - V3: At the dialog, first tap <OK button>, then immediately tap <CANCEL button> (repeat/order mutation, though unusual, tests interaction sequence)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[24] =================
[Function] The current page in AnkiDroid's Card browser for the Default deck allows users to search, sort, and view the details (including sort field and lapses) of the flashcards within the deck.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Default deck's card browser page (page 5). The core action is clicking the search button (magnifier icon) on this page. This action likely triggers a search-related interaction, and since the destination page remains the same (page 5), it may open a search input or filter the cards shown, with the flow focusing on this single click action for now.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Search button (magnifier)> twice (repeat the search button tap)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Search button (magnifier)> (skip the core search action)
 - V3: Tap <Search button (magnifier)> and then immediately tap it again (repeat the action)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[25] =================
[Function] The current page in the AnkiDroid app's card browser for the Default deck provides options to change the display order of cards and filter cards by marked status, suspended status, or tags.

[Core Logic Task]
On the Default deck's card browser page, the user clicks the 'More options' (three dots) button. This opens a menu with options to change card display order, filter by marked/suspended status, or filter by tags. The flow then branches based on which menu option the user selects (e.g., to sort, filter marked, etc.).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <More options button (three dots)> and try to perform actions (even though it's invalid, as a mutation test case to check handling of missing this step)
 - V2: Click <More options button (three dots)> twice (repeat the step)
 - V3: Click <More options button (three dots)> and then immediately click it again (order mutation of repeating the click)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[26] =================

[Function] This page in AnkiDroid's card browser for the Default deck displays flashcards with the "Sort field" as the primary column and "Lapses" as a secondary column, after selecting the "Answer" option from the column dropdown to configure the displayed card data.

[Core Logic Task]
In the AnkiDroid card browser for the Default deck, the user first interacts with the column dropdown (e.g., clicking to open options). Then, the user selects the 'Answer' option from the dropdown to configure the card data display, resulting in the flashcards being shown with 'Sort field' as the primary column and 'Lapses' as the secondary column.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Tags option> instead of selecting 'Answer' from the column dropdown in the AnkiDroid card browser for the Default deck to see how the card display configuration changes
 - V2: Omit interacting with the column dropdown and directly check the card display in the AnkiDroid card browser for the Default deck
 - V3: Repeat tapping <Tags option> multiple times and observe the card display changes in the AnkiDroid card browser for the Default deck

================= [TaskTest] FDG[70] =================
[Function] The current page in AnkiDroid's card browser for the Default deck displays flashcards sorted by the "Sort field" and "Lapses" columns, with the "Answer" column option selected to organize the card list.

[Core Logic Task]
The process starts on the page with the sorting dropdown open. The user clicks the 'Lapses' option in the dropdown, which navigates to the card browser page for the Default deck, where cards are sorted by the 'Sort field' and 'Lapses' columns with the 'Answer' column option applied to organize the list.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Lapses option> (check if default sorting changes)
 - V2: Click <Lapses option> twice (test repeated selection effect)
 - V3: Try clicking <Lapses option> with an empty state assumption (if applicable, though input not here, just repeat/order)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[71] =================
[Function] The current page in AnkiDroid's card browser for the Default deck displays flashcards with the "Answer" column (now showing "Lapses" data) after selecting the "Answer" option from the column dropdown, allowing users to view and manage card details sorted by the chosen field.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the card browser page (page 15) with the column dropdown open. They click the 'Reviews' option (though the final state shows 'Lapses'—likely a typo or context shift, but the action is to select a column option) to update the column to display 'Lapses' data for the Default deck's cards, transitioning to page 5 where the cards are shown with the new column.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit selecting <Reviews option> and check if the column still updates to 'Lapses' (though likely no change if selection is required)
 - V2: Repeat selecting <Reviews option> multiple times to see if column updates repeatedly (unlikely, but tests UI response)
 - V3: Select <Reviews option> with the expectation of 'Reviews' data (to check if the 'Lapses' display is a bug or intended, by comparing expected vs actual after selection)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[72] =================
[Function] This page in AnkiDroid displays the list of flashcard decks (e.g., "123", "Default") with due card information, allows deck management (e.g., adding new decks via the + button), and shows a summary of today’s study activity (studied cards and time).

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the Chrome welcome screen (page 17), which displays Terms of Service, Privacy Notice, and an option to send usage stats/crash reports. The user then clicks the 'Accept & Continue' button (though the provided action is for 'Send feedback', but based on the welcome screen context, the core flow here would involve accepting, but with the given action, we adjust: Wait, the provided action is 'Send feedback' from page 17 to 9. Wait, maybe the initial analysis was wrong. Wait the actions JSON has one action: action_ref [17,6], src 17, dst 9, action click, description 'Send feedback menu option'. But the functional point description is about Chrome welcome screen. Wait maybe there's a mix-up. But following the given actions: The flow starts at page 17 (maybe a menu page), then clicks 'Send feedback' (action) to go to page 9. So the logic is: The user is on page 17 (a menu), clicks the 'Send feedback' menu option, navigating to page 9. There are no branches here as only one action. Wait but the functional point description was about Chrome welcome, but the actions given are about a different app? Wait the screenshots show a different app (AnkiDroid maybe) with 'Send feedback' in the menu. So perhaps the functional point description was incorrect, but we have to follow the given actions. So: The user begins on page 17 (a side menu with options like Decks, Card browser, etc.). The user performs a click action on the 'Send feedback' menu option, which navigates to page 9. There are no branching points as the flow is a single step from page 17 to 9 via the click.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Send feedback menu option> twice
 - V2: Omit tapping <Send feedback menu option>
 - V3: Tap <Send feedback menu option> and then immediately tap it again

[Function] The page displays a pie chart in the "CARD TYPES" tab of AnkiDroid's statistics section, visualizing the distribution of different card types (Mature, Young+Learn, Unseen, Suspended+Buried) for the "Default" deck.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the statistics page (page 111) for the 'Default' deck. They click on the 'CARD TYPES' tab (action from page 111 to 112), which navigates to the page displaying the pie chart visualizing the distribution of different card types (Mature, Young+Learn, Unseen, Suspended+Buried) for the deck. There are no branches or loops in this flow as it is a single navigation action to view the desired chart.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <CARD TYPES tab> and check if the pie chart still appears (though this is likely invalid as per core logic, but for mutation testing)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <CARD TYPES tab> multiple times to see if it causes any issues (e.g., multiple chart loads or errors)
 - V3: Click <CARD TYPES tab> in a different order (though there's only one step, so this is a stretch: imagine if there were other tabs, but here we simulate an order mutation by considering a non-existent prior step, but since only this widget exists, we note it as a mutation attempt)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[143] =================
[Function] The current page (Weekly Breakdown tab in AnkiDroid's statistics) visualizes the percentage of correct answers and number of reviews (answers) for each day of the week, allowing users to analyze their flashcard study performance on a weekly basis.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the statistics page (page 112) and clicks the 'WEEKLY BREAKDOWN' tab. This action navigates to the Weekly Breakdown page (page 110), where the weekly study performance (correct answer percentage and review counts per day) is visualized.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab> and check if the Weekly Breakdown page still appears (though it should not, testing the necessity of the click)
 - V2: Click <WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab> twice (testing if repeated navigation causes issues)
 - V3: Do not click <WEEKLY BREAKDOWN tab> and check the current page's content (testing if the expected page is only shown after the tab click)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[144] =================
[Function] The page visualizes statistics related to answer buttons (Learn, Young, Mature) for the "Default" deck in AnkiDroid, showing the distribution of answers across different answer types.

[Core Logic Task]
To visualize the statistics for answer buttons (Learn, Young, Mature) in the 'Default' deck, the user clicks on the 'ANSWER BUTTONS' tab. This action switches the view to display the relevant distribution of answers across the different answer types.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> and check if statistics are still visible (repeat: try clicking <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> multiple times)
 - V2: Click <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> twice in a row to see if the view toggles or stays (order: no other steps to swap, so focus on repeat/omit)
 - V3: Attempt to click <ANSWER BUTTONS tab> with an empty interaction context (though minimal, as only this widget exists)
