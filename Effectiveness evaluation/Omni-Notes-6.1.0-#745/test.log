[Variant Paths] (0)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[2] =================
[Function] The current page (search page) allows users to search for existing notes (though none are present in the empty state) within the notes management application.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the notes page (empty state). They click the search icon, which likely opens a search input field or initiates a search action (though no notes exist to search).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Search icon> twice (repeat the search action)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Search icon> (simulate not initiating search)
 - V3: Tap <Search icon> and then immediately tap it again (order mutation with repeated action)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[3] =================
[Function] The current page (a Google voice input dialog) allows the user to attempt voice - based input again to search for notes, with the option to tap the microphone icon to speak after a previous attempt, within the context of a note - management app.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the notes page (page 0). They click the sort icon (action at [0,2]), which leads to page 2. This action likely initiates or relates to the voice input flow for searching notes, with the option to retry voice input by tapping the microphone icon.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Sort icon> and see if voice input for searching notes is still triggered
 - V2: Tap <Sort icon> multiple times (e.g., twice) to see if it affects the voice input flow for searching notes
 - V3: Tap <Sort icon> and then immediately tap it again before the voice input dialog fully loads

================= [TaskTest] FDG[4] =================

 - V3: Tap <Close menu button> first and then tap <Red circular add button>

================= [TaskTest] FDG[5] =================
[Function] The current page (side navigation menu) provides options to navigate to the "Notes" section (to manage and view notes) or to the "SETTINGS" section (to configure app preferences) within the Omni Notes Alpha application.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the side navigation menu page (page 1). From here, the user can click the 'Notes' option to navigate to the Notes section (though the destination page is still 1 in the action, implying a transition to the Notes - related page). There's also an option to click 'SETTINGS' (not included in the given action but part of the functional point's description, but since only the 'Notes' action is provided, the core logic here is the click on 'Notes' to navigate to the Notes management/viewing area).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Notes navigation option> twice
 - V2: Omit tapping <Notes navigation option> (simulate not navigating to Notes)
 - V3: Tap <Notes navigation option> with a long press (if long press is a plausible mutation, assuming the widget supports it; since the original is a tap, changing the interaction type)

[Function] This page allows users to create and manage a checklist - style note, including setting a title, adding checklist items, and viewing or modifying the reminder for the note.

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on page 3, where the user clicks the 'Text note' option. This action navigates to page 85, which is the checklist - style note creation/management page with a title field, checklist item input, and reminder display. There are no branches or loops in this initial part of the flow as only one action is provided.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Text note option> (to test if the app still navigates to page 85 without this action, though likely it won't, but it's a mutation of omitting the step)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Text note option> (to test if multiple clicks cause unexpected behavior like multiple navigations or errors)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[10] =================
[Function] The Interface settings page allows users to configure various visual and interaction-related preferences for the application, including language, text size, color scheme, and toggle options for features like the floating action button, date/time selection interface, attachment display, and date formatting.

[Core Logic Task]

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on page 4. The user clicks the 'Online manual option' (action_ref [4,8]), which navigates to page 12 (the Omni Notes user guide page). On page 12, the guide provides info on notes/categories management and options to edit, create a new page, or view revisions. There are no branches or loops here as it’s a single navigation step to access the guide.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Online manual option> (to test if the guide is accessible another way, though per core logic it's the only way here, but this is a repeat/omit mutation)
 - V2: Tap <Online manual option> twice (repeat mutation, though the app may handle it the same, but it's a mutation)
 - V3: Tap <Online manual option> (original, but since the core logic has no branches, we use repeat/omit and the only widget here)
