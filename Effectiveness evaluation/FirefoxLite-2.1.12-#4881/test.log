[Function] Launch page for services and search

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on page 0 (launch page) with various service icons (e.g., FRVR Games, Booking.com, KKday, etc.). Clicking a service icon (like FRVR Games or Booking.com) navigates to page 4. From page 4, actions like clicking Home (back to page 0), Refresh/Search (to page 5), or Menu (to page 13) are possible. From page 5, Search or Menu actions lead to page 5 (leaf for Search) or page 13. From page 13, actions like Turbo mode, Block images, Settings, or Exit navigate back to page 4 or to page 20 (for Block images).

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <FRVR Games icon>, then tap <Block images button> (skipping intermediate steps to test boundary navigation)
 - V2: Tap <Booking.com icon>, then tap <Refresh button>, then tap <Turbo mode button> (altered action sequence from original flow)

On this page, the 'Instant play' tab is active, and content begins loading (as indicated by the spinner in the screenshot). There are no branches or loops here as the main action is navigation and initial loading.

[Variant Paths] (2)
 - V1: Omit <Games icon> click (simulate app starting directly on Games page, bypassing launch page navigation)
 - V2: Repeat clicking <Games icon> multiple times (e.g., click <Games icon>, then immediately click <Games icon> again while page is loading)

================= [TaskTest] FDG[4] =================
[Function] The current page (within Firefox Lite) functions as a search interface where the user can input a query (e.g., "travel tips") to search for information, with quick access to various services/apps (like travel, news, games, and e - commerce platforms) and social media shortcuts also available on the screen.

[Function] The current page is a news page that allows users to view news content and has a refresh functionality (via the refresh icon) to update the news feed.

[Core Logic Task]
The user starts on the news page (page 2). The core action is clicking the refresh icon, which triggers the app to update the news feed. After the click, the page remains the same (dst_page_idx 2) as the refresh process executes, likely fetching and displaying updated news content.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Tap <Refresh icon> twice (repeat the refresh action)
 - V2: Omit tapping <Refresh icon> (do not refresh the news feed)

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on page 4. The user clicks the 'Tabs button' (action_ref [4,3]), which navigates to page 12 (the tab management interface). From there, the tab management interface allows further actions like viewing, switching, closing tabs, opening new tabs, or using private browsing, though only the initial navigation step is captured here.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit clicking <Tabs button> (to test if the app still navigates to tab management without this action, though likely invalid but a mutation attempt)
 - V2: Click <Tabs button> twice (repeat the navigation action to see if it causes unexpected behavior like multiple tab management pages opening)

[Core Logic Task]
The flow starts on a detailed leak group page. The user clicks the home icon button, which navigates them back to the '10 Leak Groups' list page, where leak groups with identifiers and timestamps are displayed. This is a single-step navigation flow with no branches or loops.

[Variant Paths] (3)
 - V1: Omit tapping <Home icon button> (stay on the detailed leak group page instead of navigating back)
 - V2: Tap <Home icon button> twice (repeat the navigation action, though the result may be the same as tapping once in this case)
