Wait, the first screenshot is page 38 (全部订单), second is page 39 (个人中心). So the action is clicking the back arrow on page 38 to go to page 39 (personal center). So the logic is: From the '全部订单' page (page 38), click the back arrow to navigate to the personal center page (page 39), where various personal center functions (order management, membership, credit, personal info, recommendations) are accessible. Wait, but the action is from page 38 (src) to page 39 (dst), action click (back arrow). So the step is: On page 38 (全部订单), click the back arrow to return to page 39 (去哪儿用户个人中心), which provides access to order management, membership benefits, credit services, personal info management, and recommended content. Wait, but the functional point is the personal center, so the entry is page 39? Or the action is navigating to the personal center via back arrow from order page. So the steps: S1: On page 38 (全部订单), click the back arrow (action_ref [38,0]) to go to page 39 (个人中心). Then, on page 39, the personal center functions are available. But since there's only one action, the logic is: The user navigates from the '全部订单' page (page 38) to the personal center page (page 39) by clicking the back arrow. Once on the personal center page, they can manage orders, view membership benefits, use credit services, manage personal information, or browse recommendations. Wait, but the action is the back arrow click. So the core logic here is the navigation to the personal center via the back arrow from the order page. So the steps: S1: Click the back arrow on page 38 (全部订单) to navigate to page 39 (去哪儿用户个人中心), where the personal center's functional areas (order management, membership, credit, personal info, recommendations) are accessible.
